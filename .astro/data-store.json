But here I am. Another article. Another gut-punch. Another reminder that predators aren’t rare—they’re everywhere. They blend into your memories until the mask slips.\n\n---\n\n**What Happened**\n\nIn May 2024, **Adam John**, 31, from Pontypridd, was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court to **seven years and three months in prison** after pleading guilty to multiple child sex offences:\n\n- **Three counts of sexual assault of a child**\n\n- **One count of rape**\n\nHe was also made subject to:\n\n- A **Sexual Harm Prevention Order**\n\n- **Indefinite restraining orders**\n\nThese orders are designed to protect his victims and the public from future harm—but as always, they come far too late for the lives already traumatised.\n\n---\n\n**What the Police Said**\n\nFollowing the sentencing, **Police Constable Chris Phillips** stated:\n\n> \n> *“I would like to commend the incredible bravery of the victims in reporting this attack, which has allowed us to bring a dangerous individual to justice. I hope that this sentence will serve as encouragement to other victims of sexual abuse to come forward. We will believe you and do everything we can to bring offenders to justice, no matter how long ago the offences took place.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nIt’s a comforting statement. But for many survivors, it doesn’t reflect their experience.\n\nBecause more often than not, victims aren’t believed. They’re doubted, dismissed, retraumatised—or dragged through a system that questions them more than the predator. The bravery it takes to speak out is already massive. But the fight that comes after the disclosure? That’s what breaks so many.\n\nThat’s why stories like this matter. That’s why I’ll keep writing them—until the reality starts to match the promises.\n\nSupport is available through South Wales Police here:\n[Support for rape and sexual assault](https://www.south-wales.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/rsa/rape-and-sexual-assault/)\n\nReporting guidance is also available:\n[Reporting sexual offences: Information and support](https://www.south-wales.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/rsa/rape-and-sexual-assault/reporting-rape-sexual-assault/)\n\n---\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\nI’m not writing this because I have any connection to Adam other than a long-past school memory. I’m writing this because *this is happening everywhere*, and far too often, it’s happening silently—right next to us. These aren’t strangers in alleyways. These are classmates. Co-workers. Old neighbours. People from your past.\n\n**People like Adam John.**\n\nTo the victims: you are unbelievably strong. You didn’t just survive—you made sure this man faced consequences.\nTo others still holding in your stories: you matter. You are not alone.\nTo those reading this and feeling that familiar shock of recognition: I see you. I know how that feels.\n\nWe need to keep saying their names. We need to keep writing these stories.\n\nBecause these aren’t just headlines.\nThey’re lives.\nThey’re truths.\nAnd they deserve to be told.\n\n---\n\n> \n> *“They walked our corridors. Shared our classrooms. Blended into the background like they belonged. But predators don’t wear labels—and they don’t always look like strangers. They look like people we *knew*. And that’s exactly why we have to keep speaking. Because every time we break the silence, we take some of their power back.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/file-c2adwdbvnfsheouonhpgpw_edit_114868788475442996177082121004959.jpg?w=1024)\n\n---\n\nIf any part of this story resonated with you—if you recognised someone, felt something stir, or have your *own* story that’s never been told—please know you’re not alone.\n\n🔞 **I’m currently collecting stories from adults (18+ only)** who experienced **online or offline grooming** in the early days of the internet.

It’s not just fear of authority — it’s fear of what that authority has become.\n\nIn Britain today, the ones wearing the badge are not always the ones upholding the law. Sometimes, they’re the ones breaking it — in the most violent, predatory, and protected ways imaginable. And worse still, they’re doing it under the nose of a system that doesn’t just look away.\n\nIt covers for them.\n\nOver 1,100 police officers across England and Wales are under active investigation for domestic abuse or sexual violence. Let that sink in. That’s 1,100 potential abusers — rapists, manipulators, wife-beaters — still drawing salaries, still holding power, still trusted by the public. And in many cases?\n\n**Still on duty.**\n\nBehind every statistic is a woman who wasn’t believed. A child too afraid to speak. A colleague who saw the signs and said nothing. And a uniform that shielded the predator, not the public.\n\nThis isn’t a case of “a few bad apples.”\n\nThis is rot in the roots.\n\n---\n\n### **The Numbers They Buried**\n\nIn late 2023, an FOI-backed investigation revealed that **1,131 serving officers** in England and Wales were facing allegations of **domestic abuse or sexual offences**. That number includes active duty officers with open cases of:\n\n- Rape\n\n- Coercive control\n\n- Harassment\n\n- Grooming\n\n- Assault\n\nSome of these officers had multiple complaints filed against them over the course of **years**, yet faced little to no disciplinary action. In many cases, they remained in post — patrolling neighbourhoods, responding to domestic incidents, carrying firearms.\n\nOne senior officer admitted off record: *“If we suspended every officer accused, we’d have nobody left on shift.”*\n\nLet that speak for itself.\n\n---\n\n### **Case Study: David Carrick — The Wake-Up They Ignored**\n\nDavid Carrick was a Metropolitan Police officer for two decades.\n\nIn that time, he raped or assaulted **at least 12 women** — possibly more. His methods were textbook: he isolated victims, weaponised his badge, locked women in small rooms, controlled their finances, and used the force’s name as a shield. Complaints were made. He was even arrested in 2021.\n\n**Still, the Met kept him in uniform.**\n\nThe final straw only came after public outrage reached boiling point — long after the victims were broken, long after the red flags had stacked sky high.\n\nCarrick wasn’t the outlier. He was the red flag the system refused to acknowledge.\n\n---\n\n### **A Culture of Silence, Brotherhood, and Power**\n\nWhy aren’t these officers held to account? Because the system wasn’t designed to hold them to account. It was designed to protect them.\n\nPolice forces in the UK are still allowed to **investigate themselves**. Internal misconduct panels are often made up of fellow officers. Complaints are frequently dismissed or downgraded. And whistleblowers — those inside the system brave enough to speak — are bullied, sidelined, or forced out.\n\nIn March 2023, the **Casey Review** into the Metropolitan Police confirmed what survivors and campaigners had been shouting for years:\n\n- The Met is **institutionally misogynistic**\n\n- **Institutionally racist**\n\n- **Institutionally homophobic**\n\nThe review exposed everything from officers sharing rape jokes on WhatsApp, to locker rooms defaced with swastikas and homophobic slurs. A female officer who reported sexual harassment was told she was “too emotional.” Another was sexually assaulted — and later told to \"reflect on how she dresses.\"\n\nStill, no one at the top resigned.\n\n---\n\n## **Victims, Silenced – The Power Behind the Badge**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000e98c6243af3141b7f640ea811457832451723637261.png?w=683)\n\nFor most victims of abuse, speaking out is hard enough.\n\nBut imagine this: the person who hurt you carries a badge. Has access to your records. Knows where you live. Can knock your door with the full weight of the law behind them. And if you report it?\n\nTheir mates investigate.\n\nThis is the reality for hundreds — possibly thousands — of people in the UK whose abusers aren’t strangers or strangers in uniform. They’re **officers**. Police constables. Sergeants. Senior ranks. Often the very people trained to spot signs of coercion and domestic violence.\n\nThe same tactics they’re meant to stop — they’re using behind closed doors.\n\n---\n\n### **“He Told Me No One Would Believe Me. He Was Right.”**\n\nThis is the voice of a woman whose ex-partner — a decorated officer — controlled her every move for three years. He’d monitor her calls, control her finances, and threaten her with legal retaliation if she ever left.\n\n> \n> *“He told me if I called the police, it’d be him showing up. He was right.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nWhen she finally found the courage to speak, her report was buried. The force declined to investigate, citing “lack of evidence.” She later learned that officers handling her case were close to her ex.\n\nThis is not rare.\n\nA 2022 report from the Centre for Women’s Justice detailed over **150 cases** of police-perpetrated abuse — and nearly all followed the same pattern: the victim speaks out, the officer denies it, and the complaint disappears into internal paperwork.\n\n---\n\n### **Weaponising the Badge**\n\nThis isn’t just domestic abuse with a uniform. It’s something deeper — a **calculated use of institutional power** to control, silence, and discredit.\n\nExamples include:\n\n- **Using PNC checks** (Police National Computer) to stalk ex-partners or intimidate victims\n\n- **Threatening arrest or child removal** to silence women\n\n- **Calling in favours** from colleagues to block investigations\n\n- **Turning up unannounced** at homes or workplaces after breakups\n\nOne officer was found to have accessed sensitive records of women he’d matched with on dating apps. Another threatened to plant drugs in his partner’s car if she left.\n\nThese aren’t rogue officers.\n\nThey’re products of a system that gives predators authority — and **zero meaningful oversight**.\n\n---\n\n### **Silenced by System and Shame**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file-7fdnsuhg5gaaiishgej1xo281295355857013066386526.jpg?w=1024)\n\nVictims of police-perpetrated abuse don’t just face institutional silence. They face **public disbelief**.\nBecause how do you accuse a police officer in a country where trust in “law and order” still runs deep?\n\nMany survivors reported being dismissed by friends, family, and even social services. Some were **re-traumatised by court processes** that viewed them as bitter exes or unstable witnesses. Others gave up altogether.\n\n> \n> *“I thought reporting him would bring safety. It made things worse. He had more power after I spoke out — not less.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n## **Vetting? What Vetting?**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000002bf0620aaeee0494c6bd0e567631679320390651233.png?w=683)\n\nWe’re told that police officers go through strict vetting. That every name, every record, every red flag is checked before they get the badge. That the system is designed to filter out the dangerous, the unstable, the predatory.\n\nBut in Britain, the vetting system isn’t filtering.\n\nIt’s enabling.\n\n---\n\n### **The Myth of Screening**\n\nAccording to the College of Policing, every officer must pass a “vetting check” that looks at criminal history, financial risk, social connections, and behaviour. But the reality?\n\nIt’s paper-deep.\n\nThe **Baroness Casey Review** laid it bare in 2023: officers with histories of domestic violence, sexual misconduct, and even child abuse images were **still hired** — and some were promoted.\n\nIn one documented case, a man was accepted into a force despite multiple restraining orders from ex-partners. Another had been investigated for harassment twice before being approved. And once inside? Complaints were “handled” internally — meaning they rarely led to dismissal.\n\n---\n\n### **No Central Offender Database**\n\nShocking as it sounds: **there’s no single, national database** tracking officers accused of misconduct across forces.\n\nThis means a constable fired from one area for abuse can apply to another — and unless that force digs deep, they may never know. It’s what campaigners call the “**blue wall shuffle**” — move the problem, not remove it.\n\nA 2023 HMICFRS report warned that **hundreds of officers currently serving would not have passed vetting today**. But no retrospective reviews were carried out. They were left in post.\n\nBecause firing them might make the force “look bad.”\n\n---\n\n### **The Police Who Police the Police**\n\nVetting checks are often **conducted by other officers** inside the same force. That’s right — the people greenlighting new recruits are colleagues of the very people they’re meant to monitor.\n\nIn small or under-resourced forces, this leads to fast-tracked recruitment — where potential red flags are overlooked to hit hiring targets. After all, the Tories pledged **20,000 new officers by 2023** — speed over safety became the silent rule.\n\nAnd who steps in when it all goes wrong?\n\nThe **Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC)**. Except they’re not truly independent. Many of their staff are ex-police. Investigations take years. Outcomes are watered down. Officers found guilty of misconduct frequently escape criminal charges or even keep their jobs.\n\n---\n\n### **The Bottom Line**\n\nThe vetting system is not broken.\n\n**It’s functioning exactly as expected in a culture built to protect its own.**\n\n---\n\n## **The Complaint System That Never Meant to Work**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000001d24620aa5e8df1bd61558802794760792036031075.png?w=683)\n\nWhen a police officer abuses you — sexually, physically, emotionally — your first instinct might be to report it. You gather your courage, make the call, write the statement, maybe even attend an interview. You do everything right.\n\nThen comes the silence.\nThe minimising.\nThe slow erosion of hope.\n\nBecause when the person you're reporting is in uniform, the complaint system doesn't exist to protect you. It exists to protect them.\n\n---\n\n### **Where Do Complaints Go to Die?**\n\nPolice complaints are handled by the force’s **Professional Standards Department (PSD)** — a unit inside the same organisation being accused.\n\nPSD officers are often former frontline cops. Many are personally acquainted with those they investigate. Reports can be delayed, downgraded, or quietly closed without proper action. Victims aren’t informed of updates. Evidence “goes missing.” Internal logs mysteriously vanish.\n\nA 2023 report from the Home Affairs Select Committee found that **less than 1%** of public complaints against officers for violence or misconduct led to dismissal.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\n---\n\n### **IOPC: Independent In Name Only**\n\nWhen cases are considered too serious for internal handling, they're passed to the **Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC)**. But survivors and legal experts alike say the IOPC is **slow, toothless, and compromised**.\n\n- Investigations often take **2–3 years**, leaving victims in limbo\n\n- Outcomes rarely lead to prosecution\n\n- Most penalties are limited to written warnings or internal sanctions\n\n- Some officers retire mid-investigation, escaping justice entirely\n\nOne survivor who reported a police rape waited **22 months** for an update — only to be told the case was closed with “no further action.”\n\n> \n> *“They made me relive everything. Then they buried it.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n### **“The System Works — for Them”**\n\nWhen officers are found guilty of misconduct, they're still not guaranteed to be dismissed. Some are transferred. Some are given desk jobs. Some are promoted.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2023, hundreds of officers remained in post despite confirmed **sexual misconduct, racist behaviour, or abuse of power**.\n\nIn many cases, it’s the **victims who leave** — pushed out of the job, the community, or the country, while the perpetrator stays in uniform.\n\nBecause even when survivors jump through every hoop, file every document, attend every hearing — the weight of the system leans the other way.\n\n---\n\n### **Justice Denied, Repeatedly**\n\nThese aren’t procedural glitches.\n\nThis is **institutional protection**. A closed-loop of excuses, delays, and internal deflection. One that forces survivors to either suffer in silence or go public — risking their privacy, reputation, and safety — just to be believed.\n\nAnd still, **the badge wins**.\n\n---\n\n## **Time to Dismantle the Lie**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000a2b462468583e923d14904d2_conversation_id3d67fae4e9-3b74-8002-878b-470c0fe4913f26message_id3dcf39493b-d141-4b86-8d31-45f6ae7e19ca3653990728057120923.jpg?w=1024)\n\nWe’ve been told for decades that the police protect us. That the badge means safety. That justice wears a uniform and walks among us.\n\nBut the evidence says otherwise.\n\nBehind the PR campaigns and “lessons learned” soundbites is a brutal truth:\n**Too many of Britain’s police officers are protected, not punished — even when they harm.**\n\nThey rape.\nThey groom.\nThey intimidate.\nThey silence.\n\nAnd the state lets them.\n\n---\n\n### **This Is a System — Not a Series of Mistakes**\n\nThis isn’t about one bad officer, one force, one scandal.\n\nIt’s a **repeat pattern**:\n\n- Allegations buried\n\n- Complaints ignored\n\n- Whistleblowers punished\n\n- Abusers promoted\n\n- Survivors disbelieved\n\nThe Met didn’t “fail” to stop David Carrick.\nIt **let him** keep going.\nJust like it did with Wayne Couzens, the officer who murdered Sarah Everard.\n\nHow many more Carricks are still out there?\nHow many more victims silenced by the weight of the badge?\n\n---\n\n### **Policing Cannot Be Reformed. It Must Be Rebuilt.**\n\nYou cannot “train away” misogyny when it’s built into the walls.\nYou cannot “diversify” your way out of corruption.\nYou cannot keep patching a system that was designed to shield itself.\n\nThe complaint process is a lie.\nThe vetting system is a sieve.\nThe IOPC is a shield for abusers in suits.\n\nWe demand for independent oversight, real consequences, and a system that finally, truly serves the people — not just those who wear the uniform.\n\n---\n\n### **And Until Then — We Watch. We Write. We Expose.**\n\nBecause if the state won’t protect us from predator police?\n\n**We will.**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000019f4620a9c125547980a2354_conversation_id3d67fae4e9-3b74-8002-878b-470c0fe4913f26message_id3d9fda1fb9-ce3a-4b34-8b21-05fe291425262642177803498860250.jpg?w=683)\n\n---","src/content/articles/badges-and-blind-eyes-inside-britains-rotting-police-culture.md","687a4494c96c7b99",{"html":174,"metadata":175},"\u003Cp>© *By Sophie Lewis | The Indie Leaks | The Grooming Files *| @realtalkrealtea\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000043e0620aa4395aeb73a9549e8566441672602913719.png?w=683\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"truth-that-cant-be-silenced\">\u003Cem>Truth that can’t be silenced\u003C/em>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-uniform-of-impunity\">\u003Cstrong>The Uniform of Impunity\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>There’s a reason people flinch when a cop car pulls up.

Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood wants to take this controversial policy nationwide, starting with a pilot in 20 prisons. On paper, it’s about controlling dangerous men’s urges and keeping the public safe. But as someone who’s spent years listening to survivors and investigating institutional cover-ups, I can’t help but ask: **does this really stop abuse — or just create a false sense of security?**\n\nFor many survivors and campaigners, the news feels like another chapter in a cycle of reactive measures. A cycle that never quite addresses how paedophiles and rapists gain access to victims in the first place — or why the very systems meant to protect children have failed so spectacularly.\n\nBecause this isn’t just about testosterone and tablets. It’s about the myth of control, the dangers of state overreach, and whether we’re prepared to trade **bodily autonomy for the promise of safety**.\n\nAs the headlines scream “castrate them all,” I think it’s worth asking: **Are we really tackling the roots of sexual abuse — or just silencing the symptoms for a while?**\n\n---\n\n## **The “Solution” in Context**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000002dac620abfad3f67d1141101963114356877686441.png?w=683)\n\nChemical castration is nothing new. First trialled in the 1940s as a way to control sexual urges, it’s been used in various countries to treat sex offenders — and now, it’s at the heart of the UK’s latest push to curb reoffending.\n\nAt its core, chemical castration involves two main drugs:\n\n- **SSRIs**, the same kind prescribed for depression, to blunt intrusive sexual thoughts.\n\n- **Anti-androgens**, which suppress testosterone and dull sexual arousal.\n\nOn paper, it’s about **reducing risk**. But beneath the headlines of “curing paedophiles,” the reality is far messier.\n\nThe UK has dabbled in this before — small voluntary trials in prisons in the South West of England. Those pilots, according to early data, showed a drop in reoffending rates. But crucially, they were **voluntary**. Offenders had to agree to the treatment, and they also received therapy alongside the drugs.\n\nNow, the government wants to take it further. Shabana Mahmood is considering making it **mandatory** — a move that would forcibly medicate some of the country’s most dangerous men, whether they agree or not.\n\nAnd she’s not alone in this thinking. Countries like Germany, Denmark, and France use chemical castration voluntarily. In Poland, it’s already law for certain sex crimes. Some US states also mandate it for repeat offenders.\n\nIt’s tempting to see this as progress — as finally taking predators seriously. But beneath the political theatre lies a critical question: **Can a pill really fix what’s broken?**\n\n---\n\n## **Does It Really Work?**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000b0ac62439560a8f7e537f6167092378664198169752.png?w=683)\n\nThe numbers are enticing — studies in the UK and Europe suggest that chemical castration, when combined with therapy, can cut reoffending rates dramatically. In one small British pilot, ten offenders who received the treatment didn’t reoffend at all. Another study paired a group of chemically castrated offenders with those who didn’t receive treatment, finding a **60% lower** rate of reoffending in the treated group.\n\nBut there’s a catch: **these studies are tiny**. Their sample sizes are so small that they can’t be considered solid proof of success. And they don’t answer the biggest question — does reducing sex drive **stop the core of abuse**?\n\nExperts argue that for some offenders, the abuse isn’t about lust. It’s about **power**. About **control**. And no matter how many hormones you suppress, those drivers remain.\n\nSurvivors and campaigners have another warning: it’s not enough to just “chemically tame” the person. Without **psychological treatment** — addressing why these offenders do what they do — you’re only blunting one piece of the puzzle.\n\nAnd what about **sexual preference**? That doesn’t vanish because of a pill. A paedophile’s attraction to children, for instance, might be dulled but **not erased**. The compulsion can be managed — for a time — but not cured.\n\nAs the UK edges closer to this policy, it’s worth asking: **Are we willing to treat the symptom — the urge — and pretend we’re fixing the disease?**\n\n---\n\n## **Missing from the Conversation — Female Offenders and Gender Bias**\n\nFor all the talk about chemical castration, there’s one glaring omission in the conversation: **female offenders**.\n\nWomen who commit sexual offences exist — from teachers who prey on pupils to mothers who groom their own children. Yet you rarely hear about them in these discussions. Chemical castration is designed for the biology of men — reducing testosterone and dampening the sex drive. But it does nothing for female sex offenders, who make up a small but significant portion of cases.\n\nThat’s partly because their **biological drivers** are different — but it’s also a reflection of how society tends to downplay women’s roles in sexual violence. Female paedophiles are often cast as “exceptions” or “aberrations,” not part of the larger systemic problem.\n\nThis gendered blind spot isn’t just about policy — it’s about justice. Survivors of female perpetrators are left out of the conversation entirely. And without addressing their abuse, any push for mandatory chemical castration is, at best, a **half-measure**.\n\nSo as we debate castrating male offenders, it’s worth asking: **What does that say about how seriously we take the victims of female abusers?**\n\n---\n\n## **Ethical, Legal, and Medical Quagmires**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000eadc61f48a51ac2572b1db203162729361621218649.png?w=1024)\n\nMandatory chemical castration isn’t just a medical issue — it’s a human rights minefield.\n\nAt its heart is a fundamental question: **can the state force someone to undergo medical treatment, even if it’s meant to protect the public?**\n\nThe ethical concerns are profound. Bodily autonomy is a cornerstone of human rights — the idea that no one else gets to decide what happens to your body. Forcing chemical castration crosses that line, reducing the person to a threat to be managed rather than a citizen with rights.\n\nDoctors and psychiatrists are also uneasy. Many medical professionals refuse to participate in compulsory schemes, arguing that medicine should be about **healing**, not **punishment**. Forcing them to chemically neuter patients in the name of public safety risks turning trusted health workers into agents of the state.\n\nAnd legally? It’s a grey zone. Under UK law, forced medical interventions are almost always challenged in the courts as **cruel and unusual punishment**. Even if Parliament approves mandatory castration, it’s likely to be fought all the way to the **European Court of Human Rights**.\n\nSupporters argue that these offenders forfeited their rights the moment they abused. But critics warn that **giving the state the power to forcibly medicate people sets a dangerous precedent** — one that could be misused in the future.\n\nChemical castration may promise a quick fix. But it also opens up a debate about **who gets to control our bodies — and where the line between punishment and human dignity lies.**\n\n---\n\n## **A Systemic Failure?**\n\nIf the UK’s move towards mandatory chemical castration sounds like a bold fix, it also masks a much deeper problem: **the state’s repeated failure to protect vulnerable people in the first place**.\n\nBecause let’s be honest — chemical castration is a reaction to a system that has **already failed**. It’s a last resort to manage the most dangerous offenders, a sticking plaster on a wound that’s been festering for decades.\n\nWhere were the safeguards when these offenders were first reported? Why did so many cases slip through the cracks? From social services that didn’t believe children’s disclosures to police forces that bungled investigations, the story of sexual abuse in Britain is one of **missed warnings and institutional blind spots**.\n\nFor survivors, these failures cut deeper than any pill ever could. Because for them, justice isn’t just about lowering someone’s sex drive — it’s about **being heard and protected**, long before a predator is ever jailed.\n\nChemical castration might **reduce risk**. But it doesn’t change the fact that the state keeps failing to see grooming for what it is — a pattern of manipulation that’s allowed to thrive in the shadows. And it doesn’t stop the fact that survivors still have to fight to be believed.\n\nAs we debate whether to forcibly medicate sex offenders, we’re still dancing around the bigger truth: **It’s not just about what offenders do — it’s about what the system didn’t do.**\n\n---\n\n## **A False Sense of Security?**\n\nMandatory chemical castration might make for punchy headlines and offer a sense of control in a world that often feels chaotic. But when you strip back the political posturing, what’s left?\n\nA treatment that can blunt an urge — but can’t erase a desire. A policy that targets men’s biology, but ignores women who abuse. A fix that might reduce risk, but can’t touch the roots of why sexual abuse happens: the power, the secrecy, the system that keeps turning a blind eye.\n\nFor survivors, real justice doesn’t start with drugs or hormones. It starts with being seen. Being believed. And living in a world where their safety is worth more than the state’s image.\n\nThe truth is that chemical castration might be part of the toolkit for managing risk — but it’s not a cure. It’s a patch for a system that’s been broken for too long.\n\nAs the government weighs up this drastic measure, let’s not forget what’s really at stake: **the right of every survivor to be safe, the right of every person to control their body, and the duty of the state to protect — not just punish.**\n\n---","src/content/articles/blunt-force-justice-why-mandatory-chemical-castration-wont-solve-sexual-violence.md","9c886a5aab24c31c",{"html":283,"metadata":284},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000003e08620a8ff43f2f1de113da2422350771975461101.png?w=683\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Castration as Cure?\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As an investigative journalist who’s spent some time covering grooming networks and the state’s repeated failures to protect children, I’ve seen this pattern too many times: the headlines promise a hardline fix, but the deeper problems stay buried.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The UK government’s latest plan to expand \u003Cstrong>mandatory chemical castration\u003C/strong> for sex offenders is a perfect example.

Child abuse. Domestic violence.\nAnd that’s just the officers we know about.\n\nOur teams have obtained a full, verified list documenting police, prison, and court officials across the UK who were **charged or convicted** of serious offences between 2009 and 2023.\n\nIt’s a list the public was never meant to see all at once.\nBecause when you read them together—not scattered in one-off headlines or buried in court transcripts—**the pattern is undeniable**.\n\nThese are not isolated incidents.\n**This is a system that protects itself.**\n\n---\n\n### **THE RECKONING: MORE THAN “A FEW BAD APPLES”**\n\nAmong the findings:\n\n- Officers charged with **rape**, still listed as \"proceeding\"\n\n- Child sex abuse cases buried under **internal reviews**\n\n- **Suspended sentences** handed to violent offenders\n\n- Known predators allowed to **resign quietly** or be “retrained”\n\n- Multiple convictions from the **same forces**—including the Met, GMP, and Devon & Cornwall\n\nEach one of these names wore a uniform.\nMany held authority over victims.\nSome still do.\n\nAnd behind them? A wall of silence.\nThin blue lines. PR shields. Minimal press.\n\n---\n\n### **WHAT THE DATA SHOWS**\n\nThis document, compiled from public records, tracks **over 30 pages of police, prison, and justice personne**l who were **charged or convicted** of offences between 2009 and 2023.\n\nThe snapshot you’re seeing today reflects just a portion of what's inside. Between January and June 2023 alone:\n\n- **At least 7 officers** were charged with rape or serious sexual assault\n\n- **6 officers and staff** were jailed for child sex offences or indecent images of children\n\n- **Multiple cases involved repeat offenders from the same forces**, including the Metropolitan Police, Greater Manchester Police, and Devon & Cornwall\n\n- Some cases ended in **resignation, suspension or even no action taken**, despite serious allegations\n\n- The majority received **short sentences** or **suspended terms**—even in cases involving violence, child abuse, or abuse of power\n\nEach name is linked to a force. Each offence is recorded. Each result shows us how justice was handled—or mishandled—**within the very system meant to enforce it**.\n\nThese are not accusations.\n**They are confirmed charges, convictions, and proceedings.**\nMany were reported by mainstream media, but never shown together like this.\n\n---\n\n### **SELECTED CASES: JUST A FRACTION OF THE FILE**\n\n**Metropolitan Police – April 2023**\nA serving Met officer was charged with **rape**. Listed as “proceeding.” Still under employment at the time of charge.\n\n**Greater Manchester Police – March 2023**\nAn officer received a **suspended sentence** after being convicted of **assaulting his partner**. No internal misconduct outcome disclosed.\n\n**Devon & Cornwall Police – May 202**3\nA custody sergeant was convicted of **possessing indecent images of children**. Resigned before sentencing. Avoided jail.\n\n**HMP Staff Member – February 2023**\nCharged with **misconduct in public office** after being caught in an inappropriate relationship with a prisoner. Case marked “discontinued.”\n\n**Court Security Officer – January 2023**\nConvicted of **harassment and coercive control**. No national media coverage. Allowed to resign without official misconduct sanctions.\n\n**West Midlands Police – June 2023**\nOfficer jailed for **domestic violence**, including strangulation. The force declined to comment when asked if any safeguarding failures occurred.\n\n---\n\nThese cases are not rare.\nThey’re routine. Repetitive. Systemic.\nAnd they raise one unavoidable question:\n\n> \n> **How many were quietly moved, protected, or forgotten—while still wearing the uniform of trust?**\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n### **THE PATTERN: NOT ROTTEN APPLES. A ROTTEN STRUCTURE.**\n\nWhen you lay these cases side by side, the pattern is impossible to ignore.\n\n- **Sexual misconduct, violence, child abuse, coercion, exploitation—committed by those in positions of authority.**\n\n- Charges met with **resignations instead of dismissals.**\n\n- **Minimal press coverage** unless the crime is too big to ignore.\n\n- Outcomes that favour **reputation management over public accountability.**\n\n- Internal investigations that result in **no further action, or quiet suspension.**\n\nThese are **not just failures—they’re strategic silences**. A system designed to absorb the shock, protect the institution, and wait for public attention to fade.\n\nFor every one officer charged, how many victims stayed quiet?\nFor every one case reported, how many were buried?\nAnd for every badge that slipped through the cracks—who held the door open?\n\n---\n\n### **CALL FOR ACCOUNTABILITY**\n\nThe Indie Leaks is now calling for:\n\n- A **full national audit** of all misconduct charges brought against UK police, prison, and court staff from 2009 to present\n\n- Transparent publication of disciplinary outcomes—**not just convictions, but internal actions**\n\n- Whistleblower protections for officers and staff exposing corruption inside the system\n\n- A review of how misconduct is handled across forces—and how many are allowed to quietly resign without scrutiny\n\nBecause this isn’t about scandal. It’s about **systemic danger**. And we won’t look away.\n\n---\n\n### **FULL FILE ACCESS**\n\nScreenshots of the full document have been published **below this article**. Names, dates, forces, charges, and outcomes—all shown as they appear in the source data.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018029924429773603651898547.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018052361174462322705911896.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018072594993091832671942496.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018106599149000557085161145.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018131224253949259538650568.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018155547929591711271533735.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018179627533073385179448436.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018200379146108008103230344.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018223754339998408774986962.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018244655868906231933390612.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_1743801826577975523799471971908.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018285417013107921432747843.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018304096845691566278276922.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018323258012853405500666230.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018343125069386611241990648.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_174380183639125211772538667259.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018384755010820633123643513.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018406607313379607546647724.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018427012726605850263161239.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018447244812338904762202296.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018465548014880223668211815.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018484814771920686620910520.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018503537330050114253716470.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018549038262784315018658944.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018570472360953847006937235.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018605267486553385799160145.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018628773031086091695506545.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018651065177331856067357626.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018671818073378993989695953.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018695371809197811439248781.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018713943832917742300520944.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018733772897988485215608410.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_1743801875685531649551807710408.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018778968938423889057321754.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018803808963756071674111282.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_1743801882309587720181602146744.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438018841954682617030604236961.jpg?w=1024)\n\n**This is public information—hidden in plain sight.

Safeguarding responsibility. Abused a student for years, including on school premises.\n\n**Rebecca Joynes:** Teacher. Arrested, suspended, placed on bail. Continued offending.\n\n**The question isn't just what went wrong.**\n\n**The question is: what do we do now?**\n\nBecause these cases aren't anomalies.\n\nThey're warnings.\n\nWarnings that our safeguarding frameworks have a blind spot.\n\nWarnings that protective framing creates operational space for predators.\n\nWarnings that children are being harmed because we refuse to see female perpetrators.\n\n**This final part isn't about blame.**\n\n**It's about change.**\n\nWhat Catherine Pearl and Rebecca Joynes teach us about recognition, response, and building safeguarding that actually protects all children.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT WE MISSED: THE WARNING SIGNS\n\n### **Catherine Pearl: The Institutional Blind Spot**\n\nPearl was deputy head teacher at Didcot Girls' School.\n\nShe held explicit safeguarding responsibilities.\n\nShe abused a student over \"a period of years.\"\n\nSome of this abuse occurred on school premises.\n\n**What warning signs should have been visible?**\n\nWhile specific details of Pearl's grooming behaviours haven't been made public, the facts we do know reveal patterns:\n\n**Duration: \"Years\"**\n\nAbuse that continues for years doesn't happen in complete secrecy.\n\nThere are interactions. Patterns. Behaviours.\n\n**Someone saw something.**\n\nThe question is: did they report it? And if they did, how was it handled?\n\n---\n\n**Location: School Premises**\n\nAbuse occurring on school grounds requires:\n\n- Access to private spaces\n\n- Time when others aren't present\n\n- Ability to isolate the victim\n\n- Normalisation of one-on-one contact\n\n**All of these should trigger institutional awareness.**\n\nBut when the perpetrator is the deputy head responsible for safeguarding, who questions her need for private meetings with vulnerable students?\n\n**This is the institutional blind spot in action.**\n\n---\n\n**Position: Deputy Head Teacher**\n\nPearl's senior position created multiple advantages:\n\n**Authority to be alone with students:**\n\n- \"I need to speak with her about pastoral concerns\"\n\n- \"I'm monitoring her wellbeing\"\n\n- \"This is part of my safeguarding role\"\n\n**Power to control narrative:**\n\n- If concerns were raised, she had authority to dismiss them\n\n- She could reframe boundary violations as professional care\n\n- Her position created presumption of appropriate behaviour\n\n**Access to vulnerable students:**\n\n- She knew which students were isolated\n\n- She knew which students lacked strong support networks\n\n- She had legitimate access to personal information\n\n**This is predatory exploitation of institutional role.**\n\n**And it went undetected for years.**\n\n---\n\n### **Rebecca Joynes: The Bail Period Failure**\n\nAfter being arrested for sexual offences against Boy A, Joynes was:\n\n- Suspended from her teaching position\n\n- Placed on bail\n\n- Subject to safeguarding restrictions\n\n**She then targeted Boy B.**\n\n**This represents catastrophic systemic failure.**\n\n**What warning signs were missed?**\n\n---\n\n**The Material Grooming Pattern:**\n\nJoynes took Boy A to the Trafford Centre and bought him a £345 designer belt before taking him to her flat.\n\n**This happened in public.**\n\n**In a busy shopping centre.**\n\n**With shop assistants, security, other shoppers present.**\n\n**No one reported it.**\n\n**Why?**\n\nBecause a young woman buying an expensive gift for a teenage boy doesn't trigger alarm.\n\nIt reads as:\n\n- Generous girlfriend\n\n- Kind teacher\n\n- Big sister figure\n\n**Not grooming.**\n\n**This is protective framing preventing recognition.**\n\n---\n\n**The Overnight Stay:**\n\nOn 5 October 2021, Joynes arranged for 15 year old Boy A to stay overnight at her flat.\n\n**Someone knew.**\n\nDid his parents think he was elsewhere?\n\nDid friends know where he was?\n\nDid anyone question why a 30 year old teacher had a 15 year old student staying overnight?\n\n**The protective framing creates plausibility:**\n\n\"She's helping him out\"\n\"He must be in some kind of trouble at home\"\n\"She's going above and beyond\"\n\n**A male teacher in the same situation would face immediate suspicion.**\n\n---\n\n**The Contact Pattern:**\n\nJoynes gave Boy A most of the digits of her phone number and had him guess the rest.\n\n**This is sophisticated grooming:**\n\n- Creates a \"game\" (he's actively participating)\n\n- Establishes private communication channel\n\n- Gives him sense of agency (he \"figured it out\")\n\n- Creates shared secret\n\n- Builds foundation for escalation\n\n**This pattern should be in safeguarding training.**\n\n**But it's not, because we train staff to watch for male predators.**\n\n---\n\n**The Bail Period Contact:**\n\nWhile on bail for offences against Boy A, Joynes was able to access Boy B.\n\n**How?**\n\nThe specifics haven't been made public, but the fact she could continue offending while under investigation reveals:\n\n**Inadequate monitoring:**\n\n- Bail conditions may not have been sufficiently restrictive\n\n- Compliance may not have been adequately monitored\n\n- Community awareness may have been insufficient\n\n**Protective framing created operational space:**\n\n- \"Surely this is a misunderstanding\"\n\n- \"She doesn't seem like that type of person\"\n\n- \"The allegations are probably false\"\n\n**A male teacher on bail for child sexual abuse would face:**\n\n- High level community awareness\n\n- Social isolation\n\n- Intense scrutiny\n\n- Practical difficulty accessing potential victims\n\n**Joynes continued offending because protective framing created doubt, and doubt created opportunity.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT INSTITUTIONS FAILED TO DO\n\n### **Didcot Girls' School: The Pearl Response**\n\nAfter Pearl's sentencing on 24 January 2025, the school deleted social media posts featuring her from a 2019 assembly.\n\n**This happened on 27 January 2025.**\n\n**Three days after sentencing.**\n\n**Those posts had been public for six years.**\n\n---\n\n**Timeline of institutional knowledge:**\n\n- **2023:** Offences reported to Thames Valley Police\n\n- **9 August 2023:** Pearl arrested\n\n- **10 October 2024:** Pearl charged\n\n- **November 2024:** Pearl pleaded guilty\n\n- **24 January 2025:** Pearl sentenced\n\n- **27 January 2025:** School deleted social media posts\n\n**For over a year between arrest and sentencing, the school maintained public content celebrating a person under investigation for child sexual abuse.**\n\n**Why?**\n\nPossible explanations:\n\n**1. Presumption of innocence**\n\nThe school may have felt it inappropriate to remove content before conviction.\n\n**This is reasonable but creates problems:**\n\n- Posts celebrating someone arrested for child abuse remain visible\n\n- Victims see their abuser publicly honoured\n\n- Community receives no signal that the school takes allegations seriously\n\n---\n\n**2. Reputational concern**\n\nRemoving posts would draw attention to the investigation.\n\n**This prioritises institutional reputation over victim welfare.**\n\n---\n\n**3. Protective framing**\n\n\"She can't have done this\" → \"Wait for the outcome\" → \"It must be a misunderstanding\"\n\n**Even after guilty plea, the posts remained until after sentencing.**\n\n---\n\n**What the school should have done:**\n\nUpon arrest or charging:\n\n- Remove public content featuring the accused\n\n- Provide statement acknowledging investigation without prejudging outcome\n\n- Offer support to current students\n\n- Review safeguarding procedures\n\n- Conduct internal review of any previous concerns\n\n**This balances:**\n\n- Presumption of innocence for the accused\n\n- Protection and support for victims\n\n- Institutional transparency\n\n- Safeguarding responsibility\n\n---\n\n### **The Manchester School: The Joynes Response**\n\nSpecific institutional responses from Joynes's school haven't been publicly detailed.\n\n**But we know:**\n\n- She was suspended after arrest for offences against Boy A\n\n- She was able to access Boy B while on bail\n\n- The relationship with Boy B continued until she was arrested again\n\n**Questions this raises:**\n\n**1. Were students informed appropriately?**\n\nWhen a teacher is arrested for child sexual abuse, how do you inform the student body without compromising the investigation or the accused's rights?\n\n**There's no easy answer, but silence creates risk.**\n\n---\n\n**2. Were parents informed?**\n\nDid parents of students know a teacher had been arrested for child sexual abuse?\n\nThis creates tension between:\n\n- Privacy for the accused\n\n- Safety information for parents\n\n- Investigation integrity\n\n**But parents have a right to safeguarding information.**\n\n---\n\n**3. What monitoring was in place during suspension?**\n\nJoynes was suspended from her teaching role.\n\nBut suspension doesn't prevent contact with students outside school.\n\n**Was there monitoring of:**\n\n- Social media contact?\n\n- Meeting students in public places?\n\n- Continued communication?\n\n**If not, why not?**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE: RECOGNITION\n\n### **1. Gender Neutral Safeguarding Training**\n\n**Current approach:**\n\n- Focus on male predators\n\n- Warning signs based on male perpetrator patterns\n\n- Implicit assumption that female staff are safer\n\n**Required approach:**\n\nTraining that focuses on **behaviours, not demographics:**\n\n**Warning signs regardless of staff gender:**\n\n- Seeking excessive one-on-one time with students\n\n- Contact outside school hours\n\n- Private communication channels (personal phone, social media)\n\n- Gift giving beyond token items\n\n- Sharing personal information with students\n\n- Students defending the staff member against concerns\n\n- Boundary violations (physical, emotional, professional)\n\n- Isolation of particular students\n\n- Visible favouritism\n\n- Special relationships or \"mentoring\" that excludes oversight\n\n**These behaviours are concerning regardless of who exhibits them.**\n\n---\n\n### **2. Recognising Material Grooming**\n\n**The £345 belt wasn't generosity.**\n\n**It was grooming.**\n\nStaff need training to recognise:\n\n- Expensive or inappropriate gifts to students\n\n- Taking students shopping\n\n- Buying students meals\n\n- Paying for student activities\n\n- Financial support beyond school resources\n\n**Current response:**\n\"How kind of her to help that struggling student\"\n\n**Required response:**\n\"Why is she giving expensive gifts to a student? This needs to be reported.\"\n\n---\n\n### **3. Recognising Emotional Grooming**\n\n**Predators targeting female victims often use emotional intimacy as primary grooming mechanism.**\n\nStaff need training to recognise:\n\n- Teacher sharing personal problems with student\n\n- Student becoming confidante for teacher's issues\n\n- \"Special connection\" narratives\n\n- Blurred professional boundaries\n\n- Excessive focus on one student's emotional wellbeing\n\n- Private meetings without clear professional purpose\n\n- Contact during school holidays\n\n**Current response:**\n\"She really cares about that student's wellbeing\"\n\n**Required response:**\n\"Those boundaries are inappropriate. This needs to be addressed.\"\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recognising Positional Grooming**\n\n**Catherine Pearl used her deputy head position to access and abuse a vulnerable student.**\n\nStaff need training to recognise that **senior positions create greater risk, not less:**\n\n- More authority to be alone with students\n\n- More power to control narrative if concerns arise\n\n- More institutional trust\n\n- More access to vulnerable student information\n\n- More ability to reframe inappropriate behaviour as professional duty\n\n**Senior staff should face MORE scrutiny, not less.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE: RESPONSE\n\n### **1. Taking Reports Seriously Regardless of Accused Gender**\n\n**Current problem:**\n\nWhen concerns are raised about female staff, institutional response often includes:\n\n- \"Are you sure you're not misunderstanding?\"\n\n- \"She's always been wonderful with students\"\n\n- \"Could this be a personality conflict?\"\n\n- \"Let's not jump to conclusions\"\n\n**This delays response.**\n\n**Delay creates more victims.**\n\n---\n\n**Required approach:**\n\n**All safeguarding concerns are treated with equal seriousness regardless of accused gender.**\n\n**This means:**\n\n- Same investigation procedures\n\n- Same urgency\n\n- Same suspension decisions based on risk, not gender\n\n- Same information sharing with authorities\n\n- Same support for alleged victims\n\n**Gender neutral response protocols.**\n\n---\n\n### **2. Addressing Bail Period Risk**\n\n**Joynes continued offending while on bail.**\n\n**This should not have been possible.**\n\n**What's needed:**\n\n**Robust bail conditions for anyone accused of child sexual abuse:**\n\n- No contact with children under 18\n\n- Restrictions on locations (schools, youth clubs, areas where children congregate)\n\n- Social media monitoring\n\n- Regular check-ins with authorities\n\n- Community notification where appropriate\n\n**Monitoring compliance:**\n\n- Regular verification\n\n- Consequences for breaches\n\n- Information sharing between police and schools\n\n**The fact that Joynes could access Boy B while on bail for offences against Boy A represents systemic failure.**\n\n---\n\n### **3. Institutional Transparency**\n\n**When a teacher is arrested for child sexual abuse, institutions face difficult decisions:**\n\n**What to tell students?**\n**What to tell parents?**\n**What to say publicly?**\n\n**Current approach often prioritises:**\n\n- Institutional reputation\n\n- Privacy for the accused\n\n- Avoiding panic\n\n**This can result in silence.**\n\n**Silence creates:**\n\n- Continued risk\n\n- Loss of trust when truth emerges\n\n- Message that institution prioritises reputation over safety\n\n---\n\n**Required approach:**\n\n**Transparent communication that balances:**\n\n- Right to fair investigation for accused\n\n- Right to safety information for community\n\n- Support for victims\n\n- Institutional accountability\n\n**Example communication:**\n\n\"We can confirm that a member of staff has been arrested and is under investigation for serious allegations. The individual has been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. We are working closely with police and safeguarding authorities. Support is available for any student who needs it. We take safeguarding extremely seriously and are reviewing our procedures.\"\n\n**This provides:**\n\n- Factual information\n\n- Reassurance about action taken\n\n- Support offer\n\n- Institutional accountability\n\n**Without:**\n\n- Identifying the accused\n\n- Prejudging the outcome\n\n- Creating panic\n\n---\n\n## WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE: PREVENTION\n\n### **1. Breaking Protective Framing in Recruitment**\n\n**Current approach:**\n\nFemale candidates for teaching and youth work roles benefit from protective framing:\n\n- Assumed to be inherently safer\n\n- Less scrutiny of motivation for working with children\n\n- References less likely to flag boundary concerns\n\n- Background checks same as male candidates, but informal assessment differs\n\n**This creates opportunity for predators.**\n\n---\n\n**Required approach:**\n\n**Gender neutral assessment:**\n\n- Same scrutiny of motivation regardless of gender\n\n- Same assessment of boundary awareness\n\n- Same level of reference checking\n\n- Same questions about previous roles and why they left\n\n**Questions to ask all candidates:**\n\n- Why do you want to work with children?\n\n- Describe your understanding of professional boundaries\n\n- How would you handle a student seeking excessive personal contact?\n\n- What would you do if a colleague was sharing personal problems with a student?\n\n- Describe a time you had to maintain professional boundaries in a difficult situation\n\n**These questions matter regardless of candidate gender.**\n\n---\n\n### **2. Ongoing Professional Supervision**\n\n**Current problem:**\n\nOnce hired, staff supervision often focuses on:\n\n- Academic performance\n\n- Administrative duties\n\n- Curriculum delivery\n\n**Boundary maintenance and professional relationships receive less attention.**\n\n---\n\n**Required approach:**\n\n**Regular supervision that includes:**\n\n- Discussion of any student relationships causing concern\n\n- Reflection on boundary maintenance\n\n- Peer review of one-on-one student contact\n\n- Review of any gifts given or received\n\n- Monitoring of out-of-hours contact\n\n- Discussion of emotional challenges of pastoral care\n\n**This isn't about distrust.**\n\n**It's about support and accountability.**\n\n**All staff need structures that help them maintain boundaries.**\n\n---\n\n### **3. Peer Accountability Culture**\n\n**Pearl abused a student for years.**\n\n**Someone saw something.**\n\n**Did they report it?**\n\n**If they did, what happened?**\n\n**If they didn't, why not?**\n\n---\n\n**Current problem:**\n\nStaff may hesitate to report concerns about colleagues because:\n\n- \"I might be wrong\"\n\n- \"It could harm their career\"\n\n- \"They're really good at their job\"\n\n- \"I don't want to cause trouble\"\n\n**When the colleague is female, protective framing intensifies hesitation:**\n\n- \"Women don't do that\"\n\n- \"I must be misinterpreting\"\n\n- \"She's just very caring\"\n\n---\n\n**Required approach:**\n\n**Culture where reporting concerns is:**\n\n- Expected\n\n- Supported\n\n- Protected\n\n- Acted upon\n\n**This requires:**\n\n- Clear reporting procedures\n\n- Protection for those who report\n\n- Feedback on what happened with the report\n\n- Consequences for not reporting concerns\n\n- Senior leadership modelling the behaviour\n\n**\"If you see something, say something\" must apply equally regardless of who the concern is about.**\n\n---\n\n### **4. Student Education on Grooming**\n\n**Current approach:**\n\nWe teach children to watch for:\n\n- Strangers offering gifts\n\n- Adults asking them to keep secrets\n\n- Inappropriate touch\n\n**We rarely teach:**\n\n- Teachers can be abusers\n\n- Women can be predators\n\n- Grooming can look like special attention\n\n- Professional boundaries matter\n\n---\n\n**Required approach:**\n\n**Age-appropriate education that includes:**\n\n**For all ages:**\n\n- Adults in positions of trust must maintain professional boundaries\n\n- Gifts from teachers beyond token items are inappropriate\n\n- Private contact outside school needs parental knowledge\n\n- Special relationships with teachers that exclude oversight are concerning\n\n- You can report concerns even if you're not sure\n\n**For older students:**\n\n- What grooming looks like\n\n- How predators create isolation\n\n- Why you're not to blame\n\n- How to recognise boundary violations\n\n- Where to get help\n\n**This education must be gender neutral:**\n\n\"Teachers of any gender must maintain boundaries\"\n\nNot: \"Watch out for male teachers\"\n\n---\n\n## WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE: SUPPORTING VICTIMS\n\n### **For Male Victims of Female Perpetrators**\n\n**Current barriers:**\n\n- Cultural scripts that deny victimisation (\"You're lucky\")\n\n- Lack of language to describe experience\n\n- Fear of not being believed\n\n- Minimisation of harm\n\n- Shame\n\n**Required support:**\n\n**Recognition that:**\n\n- Male victims of female perpetrators experience serious trauma\n\n- The protective framing that denies their victimisation is harmful\n\n- They deserve the same support as any other abuse victim\n\n- Their experience is valid regardless of cultural narratives\n\n**Specific interventions:**\n\n- Training for support services on male victimisation\n\n- Peer support groups specifically for male survivors\n\n- Educational resources that recognise male victimisation\n\n- Media literacy addressing harmful narratives about \"lucky\" boys\n\n**Language matters:**\n\nNot: \"Affair with teacher\"\n**Use:** \"Sexual abuse by teacher\"\n\nNot: \"Relationship\"\n**Use:** \"Grooming and exploitation\"\n\nNot: \"Sex scandal\"\n**Use:** \"Child sexual abuse\"\n\n---\n\n### **For Female Victims of Female Perpetrators**\n\n**Current barriers:**\n\n- Limited cultural language for female-on-female child sexual abuse\n\n- Double protective framing (women don't do that + same-sex trust)\n\n- Potential homophobic responses\n\n- Abuse hidden within \"mentoring\" narratives\n\n- Additional isolation\n\n**Required support:**\n\n**Recognition that:**\n\n- Female perpetrators can abuse female victims\n\n- This abuse is serious and harmful\n\n- Victims need specialised support\n\n- Professional boundaries matter in same-sex contexts\n\n**Specific interventions:**\n\n- Training for support services on female perpetration\n\n- Specialist resources for female victims of female abusers\n\n- Support that addresses confusion about trust relationships\n\n- Frameworks that don't conflate same-sex abuse with LGBTQ+ issues\n\n**The abuse is about power and exploitation, not sexual orientation.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE: INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n### **The Didcot Girls' School Question**\n\nPearl abused a student for years.\n\nShe was deputy head with safeguarding responsibilities.\n\nSome abuse occurred on school premises.\n\n**Questions the school must answer:**\n\n**1. What concerns were raised before 2023?**\n\nWere there previous complaints, observations, or concerns about Pearl's relationships with students?\n\nIf yes, how were they handled?\n\nIf no, why not?\n\n---\n\n**2. What safeguarding procedures were in place?**\n\nWhat systems existed to monitor:\n\n- One-on-one contact between staff and students\n\n- Private meetings\n\n- Out-of-hours contact\n\n- Boundary maintenance\n\nWere these procedures followed?\n\nIf not, why not?\n\n---\n\n**3. What has changed since Pearl's conviction?**\n\nWhat specific procedural changes have been implemented to prevent similar abuse?\n\nHas there been training on:\n\n- Female perpetration\n\n- Gender neutral safeguarding\n\n- Positional grooming\n\n- Recognising abuse by senior staff\n\n---\n\n**4. What support was provided to the victim?**\n\nWhat support services were offered?\n\nHow was the victim protected during the investigation?\n\nWhat ongoing support is available?\n\n---\n\n**These aren't rhetorical questions.**\n\n**They're accountability questions.**\n\n**And the school owes its community answers.**\n\n---\n\n### **The Manchester School Question**\n\nSimilar questions apply to Joynes's school:\n\n**1. What enabled her access to Boy B while on bail?**\n\nWhat monitoring was in place?\n\nWas information about her arrest shared appropriately within the school?\n\nWere parents informed?\n\n---\n\n**2.

Some even believed they were in control.\nUntil they weren’t.\nUntil the damage was done.\n\n**Let’s break it down.**\n\n---\n\n## **What the Law Says (UK)**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000009f9c62438943c241c65bf49e5023360342809195955.png?w=1024)\n\nIn the UK, the age of consent is **16**.\nThat means:\n\n- Any sexual activity with a child under 16 is illegal.\n\n- A child cannot legally consent, even if they say they can.\n\n- Misunderstanding or deception does **not excuse** an adult from responsibility.\n\nEven if a girl says she’s 16 or older, the adult has a **legal duty** to ensure that’s true. If they don’t, they are still guilty of committing a sexual offence.\n\nIgnorance isn’t a defence. “She lied” doesn’t undo the harm. The law protects children for a reason — because their brains, boundaries, and experiences are still developing.\n\n---\n\n## **Why Do Some Young People Lie About Their Age?**\n\nThis is where nuance matters — and it’s something survivors understand deeply. When a young person lies about their age, it’s not because they’re manipulative. It’s because they’ve already been shaped by a system that failed them.\n\nHere’s why a minor might pretend to be older:\n\n- They’ve been exposed to sexualisation early\n\n- They’ve learned that attention = love or safety\n\n- They see older men as powerful and validating\n\n- They are repeating patterns from earlier trauma\n\nBut none of that makes it okay.\nA traumatised child acting older is not consenting — they are surviving.\n\n---\n\n## **The Power Imbalance Is the Problem**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000aba46243ba5bd2d23ea909933011157383870785631.png?w=683)\n\nNo matter how “mature” a young person seems, there is always a power imbalance when an adult gets involved. Adults have the emotional, psychological, and social power in the situation — and with that power comes **responsibility**.\n\nThe older person *should* know better. And deep down, they usually do.\nMany groomers rely on the very fact that a child *won’t* be believed — especially if she initiated it or seemed willing.\nBut that doesn’t make it less predatory. It makes it more calculated.\n\n---\n\n## **The System Blames Children. We Don’t.**\n\nToo often, survivors of grooming grow up thinking they were to blame.\n*“I kissed him first.”*\n*“I wanted to feel grown-up.”*\n*“I told him I was older.”*\n\nBut those aren't confessions.\nThey are symptoms of conditioning, confusion, and coping.\nThey are the voices of children who were let down by adults — and then punished for surviving.\n\n---\n\n## **What Needs to Change**\n\nWe need to stop accepting “she lied” as a valid excuse.\nWe need to start teaching:\n\n- That consent isn’t just about saying yes — it’s about having the maturity to mean it\n\n- That adults are responsible for walking away, no matter what they’re told\n\n- That childhood behaviour shaped by trauma isn’t evidence of guilt — it’s a red flag for deeper harm\n\n---\n\n## **To Survivors Who’ve Been in This Situation**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000dabc620aa4b51514880530088522129490132616469.png?w=683)\n\nIf you ever pretended to be older, if you ever felt like you *chose* what happened — you weren’t to blame.\nYou were a child.\nYou were surviving.\nYou were vulnerable in ways you didn’t yet understand.\nAnd the adults around you should’ve known better.\n\nAt *The Grooming Files*, we believe in truth — even when it’s messy.\nWe believe in protecting children — even when they push boundaries.\nAnd we believe in you — even when the world tried to silence you.\n\n---","src/content/articles/but-she-said-she-was-16-why-the-law-still-calls-it-grooming.md","898bb0f33972c3a2",{"html":737,"metadata":738},"\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis - The Grooming Files | The Indie Leaks | @realtalkrealtea\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000016e46246ae24d3ed01463c8f_conversation_id3d6802dfc3-40c4-8002-87a2-7ee22facea6326message_id3dfee6c00f-6349-4ea2-a3a6-7c9da67e22b56940753949869321537.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>“She told me she was 16.”\u003C/em>\n\u003Cem>“She looked older.”\u003C/em>\n\u003Cem>“She knew what she was doing.”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>These are the most common excuses heard when adults are caught engaging with underage girls.

Wales, like the rest of the UK, has **seen a rise in reported cases**, but does this mean CSA is increasing, or are more survivors simply coming forward?\n\nThis investigation **cuts through the noise**, looking at the **real numbers**, the **factors influencing reporting**, and the **failures and improvements in safeguarding children across Wales.**\n\n---\n\n## **The Hard Facts: What Do the Numbers Say?**\n\nWhile **exact figures** on CSA remain difficult to determine due to **widespread underreporting**, what we do know is alarming:\n\n- **7.5% of adults** in the UK report experiencing **childhood sexual abuse**—equivalent to **3.1 million people.**\n\n- **Over 100,000** child sexual abuse offences are **recorded annually** by police in England & Wales.\n\n- **One in three recorded sexual offences** involves **a child victim.**\n\n### **Wales: A Regional Perspective**\n\n- **Dyfed-Powys** reported **192 CSA image-related offences** in one year—**the lowest among Wales' four police forces.**\n\n**CSA-related offences per 100,000 people:**\n\n- **Gwent Police:** 84 (Highest in Wales)\n\n- **North Wales Police:** 76\n\n- **South Wales Police:** 74\n\n- **Dyfed-Powys Police:** 37 (Lowest)\n\n**Between 2018-2023**, Wales recorded:\n\n- **13 under-18 offenders sentenced for CSA-related crimes.**\n\n- **61 allegations of sexual assault against children under 10.**\n\n- **20 child rapes in North Wales**—**more than triple** Dyfed-Powys' numbers.\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/file-7ydp7517sfbpbna6vqxqkw7847373580137799773.jpg?w=1024)\n\n## **Why CSA Appears Higher in Wales: The Bigger Picture**\n\nWales has seen **a significant rise in CSA cases being reported**—but this does **not necessarily** mean the crime itself has increased. **Several key factors** explain this surge:\n\n### **More Victims Are Coming Forward**\n\n- High-profile CSA cases have **encouraged survivors to speak out.**\n\n- **Operation Soteria Bluestone** has increased police **focus on CSA detection and survivor support.**\n\n### **Historical Abuse Cases Are Surfacing**\n\n- Investigations into **long-standing institutional abuse**, such as the **Caldey Island scandal**, have **inflated CSA statistics.**\n\n- Many cases **date back decades** but **only now** appear in official crime data.\n\n### **Online Grooming & Digital Exploitation Are Surging**\n\n- **More than half** of CSA cases now **involve online contact** between offenders and victims.\n\n- In one year alone, **over 17,500 online grooming offences** were recorded in the UK—**a 40% increase in five years.**\n\n### **Rural Policing Challenges**\n\n- **Wales has large, rural areas**, making **detecting and preventing CSA harder** than in cities.\n\n- Victims in **remote communities** often **struggle to access support services**—leading to **delayed reporting.**\n\n---\n\n## **Myth vs. Reality: Are Sex Offenders Being Moved to Wales?**\n\nA common **public concern** is that convicted sex offenders are **relocated to Wales**—particularly **rural areas like Pembrokeshire**.\n\n### **The Facts Say Otherwise:**\n\n- **No evidence** exists to suggest that offenders are **deliberately moved to Wales.**\n\n- **The number of registered sex offenders per 100,000 people in Dyfed-Powys is in line with national averages.**\n\n- **MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) manages offenders nationally**—not regionally.\n\nWhat is really happening? Increased **public awareness, exposure teams, and community-driven protests** have made CSA cases **more visible in Wales**—but this does **not mean the region is a dumping ground for sex offenders.**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image_editor_output_image1865333846-17420417321307485866275422585192.jpg?w=1024)\n\n---\n\n## **High-Profile CSA Cases in Wales**\n\nPublic perception of CSA in Wales has been **heavily shaped** by major cases, including:\n\n### **The Caldey Island Abuse Scandal**\n\n- Over **30 years of child sexual abuse** was **covered up** in a **monastic community**.\n\n- Victims came forward **decades later**, exposing **failures in church safeguarding.**\n\n### **The Lewis Edwards Snapchat Grooming Case**\n\n- A **Bridgend police officer** groomed **over 200 underage girls** online.\n\n- He admitted to **160 CSA-related offences**, including **blackmailing victims into sending explicit images.**\n\n### **Public Protests Against Offenders**\n\n- **Milford Haven (2024):** **70 people protested** the release of a convicted sex offender.\n\n- **Burton (2025):** **40 residents protested** the bail of a man accused of **abusing a baby.**\n\nThese **cases—and the media attention around them—fuel public fear**, but **the reality is more complex than headlines suggest.**\n\n---\n\n## **The Fight Against CSA in Wales: What’s Being Done?**\n\n### **Law Enforcement Crackdowns**\n\n- **Operation Soteria Bluestone**: A **police-led initiative** to **improve CSA investigations**.\n\n- **Increased digital surveillance**: **Grooming gangs, online predators, and CSA material distributors are under more scrutiny than ever.**\n\n### **Stricter Sentencing & Offender Monitoring**\n\n- **MAPPA supervision of convicted sex offenders** has expanded.\n\n- Wales has **one of the highest rates of refusal** for **offenders requesting removal from the sex offender registry.**\n\n### **Public Awareness & Exposure Teams**\n\n- Groups like **Dank Dragon**, **Predator Awareness **and **other predator-hunting teams** are **bringing more offenders to public attention.**\n\n- More **victims are empowered to speak out** due to community-driven action.\n\n---\n\n## **What Needs to Change?**\n\nDespite progress, **gaps remain** in tackling CSA in Wales. Key recommendations include:\n\n- **More specialist CSA support services in rural areas.**\n\n- **Greater police resources for online predator tracking.**\n\n- **Better education for parents and children on online grooming.**\n\n- **Harsher sentences for repeat CSA offenders.**\n\n---\n\n## **The Bottom Line: A Reality Check**\n\n- **CSA in Wales is not higher than the rest of the UK—but it is more visible.**\n\n- **Better reporting, hi8storic case reviews, and media attention make CSA seem more prevalent than statistics indicate**.\n\n- **The biggest challenges remain online exploitation, rural policing difficulties, and access to survivor support.**\n\n---\n\n## **Resources & Reporting CSA**\n\nIf you suspect CSA or need support, **contact the following organisations:**\n\n- **NSPCC:** 0808 800 5000 | [www.nspcc.org.uk](https://www.nspcc.org.uk)\n\n- **NAPAC (Adult Survivors of CSA):** 0808 801 0331 | [www.napac.org.uk](https://www.napac.org.uk)\n\n- **Childline (Under 18s):** 0800 1111 | [www.childline.org.uk](https://www.childline.org.uk)\n\n- **CEOP (Online CSA Reporting):** [www.ceop.police.uk](https://www.ceop.police.uk)","src/content/articles/child-sexual-abuse-in-wales-the-reality-behind-the-numbers.md","a7eabfb71a5bd75a",{"html":819,"metadata":820},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image_editor_output_image-603009-1742041251404176008671089888850.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"how-big-is-the-problem\">\u003Cstrong>How Big is the Problem?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a \u003Cstrong>silent epidemic\u003C/strong>—hidden, underreported, and devastating in its impact.

06.04.2025\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/received_17939135678443922201267990088672155.jpeg?w=865)\n\n---\n\n### **WHEN THEY CAN’T DISPROVE YOU — THEY SILENCE YOU**\n\nThere’s a quiet war happening in Britain. It’s not on battlefields or in headlines. It’s happening in inboxes, admin panels, shadowbanned posts, police warnings, and gag orders. It’s happening to the people who got too close to the truth — and refused to shut up.\n\nFrom child protection activists and prison reformers to anti-corruption campaigners and independent journalists, groups across the UK are now reporting the same disturbing trend:\n**The system isn’t defending itself with evidence. It’s using suppression.**\n\nIt starts small. A post gets taken down. A page gets restricted. A police officer “has a word.” Then comes the warning: “You’re causing unrest.” “You’re sharing misinformation.” “You’re interfering with active matters.” But the targets? They’re the ones exposing what officials refuse to.\n\nAt first, you think it’s a glitch. Then you realise it’s a pattern.\n\nActivism teams like **Predator Awareness** and the **HMP Prisons Justice Group** are now documenting what looks like **political silencing in real time** — bans, shadowbans, legal threats, harassment, and even community members being told by police not to share their content or face arrest.\n\nOne follower received a warning from **Staffordshire Police**: share any more Predator Awareness videos, and you could be held in custody. The reason? “False information” that might lead to “unpleasant riots and violence.” No court order. No legal review. Just a call and a threat.\n\nThese aren’t isolated cases. This is institutional damage control — dressed up as “safety,” “ethics,” or “misinformation prevention.” But let’s call it what it is:\n\n**Suppression. Because exposure is dangerous.**\n\nThis isn’t just about predator groups, prison protests, or any single campaign.\nIt’s about all of us — anyone who ever tried to peel back the curtain and speak the truth, and found a boot on their throat instead.\n\n---\n\n### **THE NEW CENSORSHIP — STATE SANCTIONED, PLATFORM ENABLED**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000e36051f7bebc605551c7c45b_conversation_id3d67ec6c4f-c9e4-8002-8628-2ab161182db726message_id3d6abaf3a7-5a19-4ba1-839a-5aeccd94db2d_edit_54233651781902843387450089424962.jpg?w=1018)\n\nYou won’t see a smoking gun. That’s the point.\n\nThere’s no official letter saying, “We’re silencing you.”\nNo memo titled, “Destroy this activist group.”\nIt’s quieter than that. Smarter. More plausible.\n\nYou’ll see it in shadowbans that never get acknowledged.\nIn FOI requests that mysteriously vanish or come back empty.\nIn activists who vanish from search results, even as they scream into the void.\n\nThis isn’t China. This is Britain — and the censorship is polite.\n\nAccounts are flagged behind the scenes. Posts are removed without notice. Warnings come with a wink:\n*“We’re not saying stop… we’re just saying be careful.”*\n\nThe **Predator Awareness** team has been hit repeatedly. Their Facebook videos removed. Their followers harassed. Police turning up at doors for *sharing posts*. In one case, a supporter was told by police: stop reposting or face legal action. No court order. No trial. Just intimidation.\n\nThe **HMP Prisons Justice Group**? Same playbook. Their coverage of deaths, corruption, and protest action at G4S-run prisons led to:\n\n- Sudden takedowns of live content\n\n- Threats of arrest for filming in public\n\n- Accounts being “algorithmically suppressed”\n\n- Police warnings issued with no formal paperwork\n\nAnd yet, they persist — because the system they’re exposing has blood on its hands.\n\nAcross the board, whether you're documenting police misconduct, child protection failures, or private prison abuse, the rules are the same:\n\n**Once your work starts shaking the foundations — they make sure no one hears you.**\n\n---\n\n**THE SYSTEM NEVER SLIPS — IT STRANGLES QUIETLY**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_000000008bdc51f783d24f1106bc3d5a_conversation_id3d67ec6c4f-c9e4-8002-8628-2ab161182db726message_id3defb404be-9c79-4570-9276-b0afbb29f7595485964253322477355.jpg?w=1024)\n\nThis is **modern-day censorship**. It doesn’t burn books. It buries truth beneath policy, algorithms, and plausible deniability.\n\nYou’re not being silenced, they’ll say. You just violated “community standards.”\n\nYou’re not being harassed, they’ll say. You’re just “under review.”\n\nBut we know the game. And we’re not playing by their rules anymore.\n\n---\n\n### **SILENCE THE MESSENGERS — WHEN TELLING THE TRUTH GETS YOU JAILED**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/screenshot_20250329_143640_com_facebook_katana_mediagalleryactivity7926101668310651767.jpg?w=1024)\n\nIf you think this is just about social media bans, you’re not paying attention.\n\nBecause when exposure gets too close to the bone — when it starts drawing blood — the state doesn’t just silence you. It comes for you.\n\n**Zack Griffiths**, the founder of the **HMP Prisons Justice Group**, didn’t just talk about corruption inside Parc. He uncovered it. He exposed **staff smuggling drugs** into the prison — not as a theory, but with **receipts**.\n\nAnd what happened?\n\n**He got arrested.**\n**He was charged.**\n**He served time.**\n\nThat’s not a conspiracy. That’s **how power protects itself**. When someone pulls the curtain back on the rot, the full weight of the system turns and crushes the whistleblower.\n\nLet’s be crystal clear:\nThis was **not** about the recent leaked staff messages — it was **before** that. Zack was already naming names, tracing corruption, and exposing how **deep the collusion runs between staff, private firms, and silence at the top**.\n\nSo they put him away.\n\nYou’re not allowed to tell the truth in this country. Not when it makes contracts shake.\n\nAsk yourself this:\n\n- Why does the BBC still refuse to acknowledge G4S ever protected their buildings?\n\n- Why are campaigners documenting prison deaths treated like criminals?\n\n- Why do victims of abuse get silenced while the institutions that failed them get PR teams?\n\nAnd for those still thinking, “This couldn’t happen here” — remember Isaac Kappy?\n\nAn actor. A whistleblower. A man who went public with dark allegations against the powerful.\n\nThey said he “jumped” from a bridge. Just like that.\nCase closed. Nothing to see.\n\nBut we know this script.\nWe’ve seen how it ends.\nAnd we’ve learned — **when someone’s screaming the truth, they’re often labelled crazy. Until they vanish.**\n\nWe’re not saying Zack’s case is the same. But the warning signs are there.\n\nThis isn’t justice. It’s a **deterrent**.\n\nAnd it’s working. Because for every activist who steps forward, there are ten more who back down, scared shitless.\n\nBut we’re done backing down.\n\n---\n\n### **THIS ISN’T A GLITCH — IT’S THE BLUEPRINT**\n\nZack wasn’t an outlier. He was the **canary in the coal mine**.\n\nBecause what happened to him is now happening everywhere — to any group, page, or person that dares to expose rot at the root.\n\n**Predator Awareness?**\nSilenced.\nWarnings from police. Pages restricted. Team members threatened with arrest — not for abuse, but for reporting it.\n\n**HMP Prisons Justice Group?**\nTargeted.\nTheir posts throttled. Accounts flagged. Protestors **physically attacked** outside the BBC building in Salford just last week — and the media? **Silent.** The only coverage came from **independent pages**.\n\n**Online exposure teams?**\nDe-platformed, demonised, doxxed.\nWhy? Because they’re confronting what the state refuses to admit: the system **doesn’t protect children.** It protects **reputation**.\n\n**Housing activists?**\nSurveilled.\nSpied on under “domestic extremism” protocols. People fighting for basic shelter being tracked like terrorists.\n\n**Anti-surveillance campaigners?**\nGagged with NDAs.\nSome community workers — especially those uncovering racism or bias in Prevent — are reportedly being made to sign non-disclosure agreements **just for doing their jobs.**\n\nLet that sink in:\n**State-funded programmes. Supposed to protect us. Silencing the people who catch them failing.**\n\nAnd the press? They’re in on it.\nThe BBC didn’t just benefit from G4S — they physically **assaulted peaceful protestors** calling them out. They broke banners, snatched equipment, and then went back inside to report... on **nothing.**\n\nThis isn’t a few bad apples.\n\nThis is the **playbook**.\n\n- **Discredit the group**\n\n- **Throttle their reach**\n\n- **Threaten legal action**\n\n- **Deny them airtime**\n\n- **Watch them burn out**\n\nAnd if all that fails?\n**Arrest the leader. Ruin the reputation. Send a message.**\n\nThis is what happens when activism edges too close to the truth.\nWhen your facts are too sharp. When your story pulls threads they can’t afford to unravel.\n\nIt’s not a glitch.\nIt’s not a misunderstanding.\nIt’s **the system working exactly as it was designed to.**\n\nBecause if they can make you **look like the threat**, they don’t have to deal with the actual ones.\n\n---\n\n### **THE CHOREOGRAPHY OF SILENCE**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_000000005ef051f7a94b8f82548b1353_conversation_id3d67ec6c4f-c9e4-8002-8628-2ab161182db726message_id3d390cc61e-e861-446f-8abd-1a94d6ec4c46574056990511461414.jpg?w=683)\n\nWhen they can’t deny the facts, they target the messenger. And every activist close to the fire knows the pattern — because they’ve lived it.\n\nThis isn’t just social media censorship.\nIt’s **choreographed suppression** — a machine of quiet shutdowns, legal intimidation, and algorithmic erasure.\n\n#### **Censorship by Algorithm**\n\nFacebook pages vanish mid-campaign.\nLive streams crash without warning.\nPosts are shadowbanned the moment they gain traction.\n\n**Predator Awareness?**\nPost reach dropped 80% after calling out state failures. Their admin dashboard lit up with “policy violations” — for content **they’d already posted a dozen times before.**\n\n**HMP Justice Group?**\nFlagged for “harmful behaviour” after uploading court transcripts — **public records.** They received **no appeal.**\n\nMeanwhile, graphic content of real abuse circulates freely — as long as it doesn't threaten institutions.\n\n#### **Policing Dissent**\n\nOffline? It’s no better.\n\nTeam members are getting home visits.\nWarnings. “Just a chat.” Thinly veiled intimidation.\n\n**Zack Griffiths** was one of the first. After exposing misconduct inside HMP Parc, he was arrested and given a **custodial sentence.** Officially for a separate issue — but those close know the truth: **he made the wrong people uncomfortable.**\n\nIt’s a pattern:\n\n- Call out systemic failure\n\n- Get a knock at the door\n\n- Suddenly your life is in the dock\n\nAsk around. You’ll hear the same phrases:\n\n> \n> “They showed up after the live.”\n> “They told me to stop asking questions.”\n> “They flagged me as a domestic threat.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n#### **State-Backed Gaslighting**\n\nAnd then comes the psychological warfare.\n\n- FOIs denied with vague “public interest” clauses\n\n- Whistleblowers branded as “troublemakers”\n\n- Survivors retraumatised by the institutions they turned to for help\n\nYou’re not just ignored — **you’re reclassified.**\n\nAs unstable. As extreme. As a threat.\n\nThat’s not coincidence. That’s by design.\n\n#### **And Then... They Erase You**\n\nYou’ll never read about it in The Guardian.\nYou won’t hear it on BBC Radio 4.\nBut you will see the slow deletion of voices that matter.\n\n**Where’s Isaac Kappy now?**\nWhere are the whistleblowers from G4S Medway?\nWhy did the Brook House exposé take **years** to air, even after footage was confirmed?\n\nBecause when people start connecting dots, the system pulls the plug.\n\nNot with fanfare.\nNot with sirens.\nBut with quiet, surgical efficiency.\n\n> \n> One account at a time.\n> One inbox frozen.\n> One witness discredited.\n> One page taken down.\n> \n> \n> \n\nThis is not a conspiracy theory.\nIt’s the **back-end admin panel of authoritarianism.**\n\nAnd if you’re not scared yet — you haven’t been close enough.\n\n---\n\n### **TOM BLEWITT — TARGETED FOR PROTECTING CHILDREN**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/screenshot_20250329_143716_com_facebook_katana_immersiveactivity8514567691156372949.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_174325914967421747430880440077.jpg?w=918)\n\nIf you think this ends with Zack, think again. **Tom Blewitt**, founder of **Predator Awareness**, has faced relentless attempts to shut him down — not because he’s breaking laws, but because he’s breaking illusions.\n\nHis crime? **Protecting children when the system failed to.**\n\nFrom online awareness to public awareness campaigns and protests. Tom’s work has rattled cages — and the state didn’t like it. What followed?\n\n- **Police harassment.**\n\n- **MP complaints.**\n\n- **Facebook restrictions and post removals.**\n\n- **Persistent shadowbans across platforms.**\n\n- **Attempts to discredit him through backchannels.**\n\n**They tried to s**ilence him. And he’s still standing.\n\nWhen the police warned supporters they could be arrested for sharing **Predator Awareness** posts, they weren’t preserving peace — **they were preserving power**.\n\nLet’s be real:\nTom’s work exposes a harsh truth — that **citizens are doing the job the authorities refuse to**. And instead of thanking him, they’ve spent years trying to **erase him**.\n\nThat alone should tell you everything.\n\n---\n\nThis is not about mistakes.\nThis is not about chaos.\nThis is about **control** — layered, polished, rehearsed.\n\nYou think the system slips up?\nNo. It tightens. It calibrates. It calculates exactly how much truth the public can stomach — and then scrapes the rest off the plate.\n\nBecause the truth doesn’t die in darkness.\nIt dies **under stage lights.**\n\n---\n\n### **CONTAINMENT, NOT JUST COVER-UP**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000060451f7ad2603da51ee8588_conversation_id3d67ec6c4f-c9e4-8002-8628-2ab161182db726message_id3d585b3587-3b7b-4f2f-aa76-60a43b2528e72775282034561989887.jpg?w=683)\n\nThe biggest lie? That what’s happening is random. That these failures are scattered — tragic, but disconnected.\n\nBut they are not disconnected. They are **deliberately partitioned.** Like fire doors in a building.\n\nYou can scream about:\n\n- Grooming gangs in Rochdale\n\n- Overdose deaths at Parc\n\n- NHS whistleblowers buried in tribunals\n\n- School children flagged by silent AI risk tools\n\nAnd the system will nod.\nSympathise.\nApologise.\n\nThen re-route the pressure — until you’re trapped shouting in a box they built **just for you.**\n\n**It’s not a cover-up. It’s containment.**\nLet the fire rage — just don’t let it spread.\n\n---\n\n### **THE HANDOVER OF HARM**\n\nFrom Government to Privatisation.      From G4S to Mitie.\nFrom Interserve to EMCOR.\nFrom “lessons will be learned” to “we no longer use that contractor.”\n\nBut the same doors slam.\nThe same FOIs get denied.\nThe same deaths pile up.\n\nThey don’t change the system. They change the **signature.**\n\n**This is harm, handed over.**\n\nAnd the press? They’ll report the change. Not the rot.\n\n---\n\n### **YOU'RE NOT PARANOID. YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION.**\n\nIf you’ve ever felt like you’re being silenced — you are.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered why some stories never break — they do. **Then they’re buried.**\n\nIf you’ve ever asked, *“Why doesn’t anyone care?”*\nThe answer is: **they do. But caring is no longer enough.**\n\nBecause this isn’t about neglect.\nIt’s about protection.\nOf reputations. Contracts. Power. Control.\n\nAnd anyone who chips away at that?\n\n- **Labelled.**\n\n- **Muted.**\n\n- **Removed.**\n\nNot with bullets.\nWith policies.\nWith systems.\nWith plausible deniability.\n\n---\n\n### **WE KNOW BETTER NOW**\n\nWe know the truth isn't slipping through cracks — it's being **pushed** through them.\n\nWe know the frontline isn’t just in prisons or councils — it’s in comments, inboxes, FOI queues, and suppressed posts.\n\nWe know this isn’t a glitch.

However, after speaking with management, the team was able to verify he was working that day.\n\nTo maintain public safety, the confrontation took place away from the premises.\n\n### **The Problem of Known Predators in Public-Facing Roles**\n\nCases like this highlight **a disturbing pattern—offenders managing to secure employment in places where they have access to children, despite extensive evidence of their predatory behaviour.**\n\n🔹 **Are employers failing to conduct proper background checks?**\n🔹 **Do some businesses protect employees instead of prioritising public safety?**\n\nThese are **serious questions** that need addressing in the wake of Arnott’s arrest.\n\n---\n\n## **A Predator With a Disturbing History **\n\nFollowing his arrest, **Dank Dragon issued a public call for victims**, after receiving reports that **Arnott may have a history of offending that extends beyond online decoys.**\n\nWhile questioned by the team, **Arnott denied being a paedophile but openly admitted to sending indecent images to minors**—a contradiction seen in many similar cases.\n\nWhen confronted about his actions, he **attempted to downplay his behaviour** by blaming substance use:\n\n> \n> **“I don’t make mistakes when I’m not off my head like.”**\n> \n> \n> \n\nA Dank Dragon team member immediately challenged this, asking:\n\n> \n> **“So, you’re only abusing children when you’re drunk, then?”**\n> \n> \n> \n\nArnott, appearing flustered, responded:\n\n> \n> **“No, not really, no… but it’s just…”**\n> \n> \n> \n\nThis **partial admission and evasive response** raise concerns about whether this is **part of a larger pattern.**\n\n---\n\n## **Family Protection and the Growing Pattern of Denial**\n\nBefore Arnott’s workplace confrontation, **exposure teams visited his home**, where **his family denied he was there.**\n\nWhile they **did not refute the allegations**, their **immediate defensiveness and refusal to acknowledge his whereabouts** reflect **a wider trend in similar cases—where families shield offenders instead of holding them accountable.**\n\n🔹 **Why do some families choose to protect predators rather than ensure justice is served?**\n🔹 **Is there a culture of silence surrounding abuse in certain communities?**\n\nThese **uncomfortable but necessary questions** must be addressed as part of the wider conversation about tackling predatory behaviour.\n\n---\n\n## **Police Intervention & Arrest – Was Law Enforcement Too Slow?**\n\nAs the confrontation unfolded, **South Wales Police arrived on the scene.**\n\nDank Dragon's Team

activity and suspected history.**\n\n🔹 **The Team debriefed the officers and they conducted an arrest.**\n🔹 **Arnott’s belongings were confiscated, and he was placed into a police van.**\n\nPolice have **not yet made a public statement** regarding the charges Arnott may face.\n\n### **The Question of Law Enforcement Response Times**\n\nArnott had already been **flagged by multiple exposure teams** before being located.\n\n🔹 **Would law enforcement have acted as quickly without exposure teams intervening?**\n🔹 **How many predators continue offending simply because they haven’t yet been ‘caught’?**\n\nThe reality is that **many cases slip through the cracks, leaving children vulnerable.** Exposure teams argue that **without their work, many of these predators would never be caught.**\n\n---\n\n## **What Happens Next?**\n\nWith **police now handling the case**, potential developments could include:\n\n- **Formal charges** related to sending indecent images to a minor.\n\n- **Further investigation** into past behaviours, particularly given reports of non-decoy victims.\n\nThe wider question remains: **Will this case prompt stricter measures to prevent predators from accessing public spaces where children are present?**\n\n---\n\n## **Resources & Reporting – Protecting the Vulnerable**\n\nIf you suspect online grooming or have information about

Despite **public outcry**, he was **not given a prison sentence** but was instead placed on the **sex offenders register for five years**.\n\nCampaigners argue that **this decision has failed to protect the community** and has **forced the victim to live in fear.**\n\nA protest organiser stated:\n*\"We are demanding that this predator is removed from the area immediately. No child should have to live in fear because the system works against them. We need as many people as possible to stand with us and show that we will not allow this to happen.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Housing Policies Under Scrutiny**\n\nOne of the biggest questions this protest raises is: **Why are convicted sex offenders being housed in areas with schools, nurseries, and even near their victims?**\n\nHousing associations like **Bron Afon** are responsible for placing individuals in accommodation, but there are growing concerns that **safeguarding measures are not being properly enforced.**\n\n🔹 **Are risk assessments being conducted before housing placements?**\n🔹 **Why was the victim not prioritised in this decision?**\n🔹 **Should there be stricter regulations preventing offenders from living near schools?**\n\nAttempts to obtain a **statement from Bron Afon regarding this case** have so far been unsuccessful.\n\n---\n\n### **Protest Details & How to Get Involved**\n\n📍 **Location:** Bronllys Place, Croesyceiliog, NP44 2DW\n🗓️ **Date:** Monday, 17th March\n⏰ **Time:** 6 PM\n\nProtest organisers are calling on **local residents, parents, and anyone concerned about child safety** to attend, even if just for **30 minutes**, to show support.\n\n*\"We need to stand together as a community. This isn’t just about one case—this is about making sure our children are protected and that those who harm them are not given priority over their safety.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **The Bigger Picture: A Broken System?**\n\nThis case highlights a **much wider issue**—how the **justice system and housing policies handle convicted sex offenders.**\n\nMany feel that **offenders are given more protection than victims**, and without **public pressure**, decisions like this will continue.\n\n📢 **Do you think current housing policies are failing communities? Should stricter laws be in place to prevent situations like this?**\n\n**Let us know your thoughts, and if you are local, join the protest to stand against a system that prioritises offenders over child safety.**\n\n---","src/content/articles/cwmbran-community-calls-for-action-protest-against-convicted-sex-offenders-housing-placement.md","c6565f595a2d72ec",{"html":1107,"metadata":1108},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image_editor_output_image-1141138307-17420836093772626990286926765506.jpg?w=778\" alt=\"\">*Image Credit: Protect Our Children. *\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"residents-demand-relocation-over-safety-concerns\">\u003Cstrong>Residents Demand Relocation Over Safety Concerns\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Cwmbran, South Wales\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A community-led protest is set to take place on \u003Cstrong>Monday, 17th March at 6 PM\u003C/strong> in \u003Cstrong>Croesyceiliog (Bronllys Place, NP44 2DW)\u003C/strong> to demand the immediate removal of a convicted sex offender who has been housed near schools and, most concerningly, close to his victim.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Outraged residents argue that the local housing association, \u003Cstrong>Bron Afon\u003C/strong>, has failed to prioritise child safety by allowing a \u003Cstrong>convicted child abuser\u003C/strong> to live in a \u003Cstrong>residential area filled with vulnerable children and within proximity of the victim.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-outrage-why-the-protest-is-happening\">\u003Cstrong>The Outrage: Why the Protest is Happening\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The protest was sparked after \u003Cstrong>Matthew Thomas\u003C/strong>, convicted in 2024 of \u003Cstrong>two counts of assault by touching a child under 13\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>one count of exposure\u003C/strong>, was placed in a \u003Cstrong>residential area close to multiple schools and nurseries\u003C/strong>.

Both exploited positions of trust. Both committed serious sexual offences against children.\n\n**But the tactics they used were different.**\n\nNot because one was more calculating than the other.\n\nBecause predators adapt their grooming strategies based on what works with their intended victim.\n\n**Gender matters in grooming.**\n\nNot because boys and girls experience harm differently (they don't).\n\nBut because predators exploit different vulnerabilities, different social scripts, and different cultural expectations depending on who they're targeting.\n\nUnderstanding these tactical differences isn't academic.\n\n**It's operational.**\n\nBecause if we only recognise one grooming pattern, we miss half the predators.\n\n---\n\n## THE TACTICAL SPLIT: MALE VICTIMS VS FEMALE VICTIMS\n\n### **Rebecca Joynes: Grooming Male Victims**\n\n**The Material Grooming Pattern:**\n\nWith Boy A, Joynes used material gifts as a grooming tool.\n\nOn 5 October 2021, she took him to the Trafford Centre and bought him a £345 designer belt before taking him back to her flat for sex.\n\n**Why a belt?**\n\nBecause it's:\n\n- Visible (worn daily, seen by peers)\n\n- Status conferring (designer brand)\n\n- Explicable (a teacher helping a student who needed it)\n\n- A marker of the \"special relationship\"\n\n**The material grooming wasn't about the item itself.**\n\n**It was about creating a sense of obligation, special status, and secrecy.**\n\n\"She bought me this. She chose me. I owe her something. This is between us.\"\n\n---\n\n**The Flattery and Status Elevation Pattern:**\n\nFemale predators targeting male victims often deploy what researchers call \"status elevation grooming.\"\n\nThe message conveyed to the boy is:\n\n- \"You're more mature than other boys your age\"\n\n- \"I can talk to you like an adult\"\n\n- \"You're special\"\n\n- \"This is what real relationships look like\"\n\n**This exploits specific male adolescent vulnerabilities:**\n\n- Desire to be seen as mature\n\n- Social status among peers (having an attractive older woman interested)\n\n- Cultural scripts about male sexuality (sex as achievement)\n\n- Lack of framework to recognise victimisation\n\n**The protective framing reinforces this.**\n\nWhen a 30 year old woman sexually abuses a 15 year old boy, cultural scripts tell him he's lucky, not harmed.\n\n**The predator knows this.**\n\n**And uses it.**\n\n---\n\n**The Isolation Through Flattery:**\n\nJoynes isolated her victims not through threats (the typical male predator tactic with female victims) but through manufactured intimacy.\n\nThe grooming process creates a pseudo relationship where:\n\n- The victim feels chosen\n\n- The abuse is reframed as consensual\n\n- Disclosure becomes betrayal\n\n- Speaking out means losing the \"relationship\"\n\n**This is sophisticated predation.**\n\nIt exploits the victim's developmental stage, the cultural devaluation of male victimisation, and the protective framing of female perpetrators.\n\n---\n\n### **Catherine Pearl: Grooming Female Victims**\n\nPearl's case involves different tactical elements because the victim's gender creates different vulnerabilities and different cover.\n\n**The Safeguarding Role as Grooming Tool:**\n\nPearl wasn't just a teacher. She was deputy head with explicit safeguarding responsibilities.\n\n**This position provided:**\n\n- Legitimate access to vulnerable students\n\n- Authority to have private, one on one interactions\n\n- Institutional trust (she's literally responsible for preventing abuse)\n\n- Plausible deniability (all contact can be framed as pastoral care)\n\nFor a female victim being groomed by a female authority figure, the abuse is often embedded within a mentoring or special care relationship.\n\n**The grooming doesn't look like grooming.**\n\n**It looks like exceptional pastoral support.**\n\n---\n\n**The Emotional Grooming Pattern:**\n\nWhere Joynes used material gifts and status elevation with male victims, female predators targeting female victims often use emotional intimacy as the primary grooming mechanism.\n\n**This includes:**\n\n- \"I understand you in ways others don't\"\n\n- \"You can tell me things you can't tell anyone else\"\n\n- \"Our connection is special\"\n\n- \"I'm the only one who really sees you\"\n\n**This exploits:**\n\n- The victim's need for validation\n\n- Developmental identity formation\n\n- Isolation from peers or family\n\n- Trust in female authority figures as inherently safe\n\n---\n\n**The Boundary Dissolution:**\n\nPearl's abuse occurred \"over a period of years\" and included incidents on school premises.\n\n**This suggests a pattern of gradual boundary erosion:**\n\n- Professional boundaries → blurred into personal relationship\n\n- Appropriate touch → progressed to inappropriate contact\n\n- School setting → became location of abuse\n\n- Teacher role → merged with abuser role\n\n**For the victim, this creates profound confusion:**\n\nThe same person responsible for her safety is violating her.\n\nThe same environment meant to protect her (school) is where abuse occurs.\n\nThe same relationship that felt supportive becomes the source of harm.\n\n---\n\n## WHY THESE TACTICAL DIFFERENCES MATTER\n\n### **For Recognition:**\n\nIf safeguarding training focuses only on male predator tactics (threats, physical coercion, stranger danger), we miss female predator tactics:\n\n- Material grooming presented as generosity\n\n- Status elevation framed as recognising maturity\n\n- Emotional intimacy disguised as pastoral care\n\n- Professional relationships that gradually become abusive\n\n**Different tactics require different recognition frameworks.**\n\n---\n\n### **For Response:**\n\nWhen a male victim reports that his female teacher bought him expensive gifts and they had sex, the protective framing reframes it as:\n\n- \"He's exaggerating\"\n\n- \"He wanted it\"\n\n- \"She was just being nice\"\n\n- \"Boys that age fantasise about teachers\"\n\n**These responses deny victimisation.**\n\nWhen a female victim reports abuse by a female teacher, additional barriers emerge:\n\n- Limited cultural language for female on female child sexual abuse\n\n- Potential homophobic assumptions about the victim\n\n- Double protective framing (women don't do that + it's just close friendship)\n\n- Institutional investment in protecting the perpetrator's professional reputation\n\n**Different victim genders face different disclosure barriers.**\n\n**Effective response requires understanding both.**\n\n---\n\n### **For Prevention:**\n\n**Gender neutral safeguarding must account for tactical diversity:**\n\n**Warning signs for material grooming (often male victims):**\n\n- Unexplained expensive gifts\n\n- Teacher paying for student activities\n\n- Special trips or outings\n\n- Visible markers of \"chosen\" status\n\n**Warning signs for emotional grooming (often female victims):**\n\n- Excessive one on one time\n\n- Blurred professional boundaries\n\n- Teacher sharing personal information\n\n- Student isolated from peers\n\n- \"Special relationship\" dynamics\n\n**Warning signs common to both:**\n\n- Contact outside school hours\n\n- Private communication channels\n\n- Secrecy about the relationship\n\n- Victim defending the adult against concerns\n\n- Changes in victim behaviour or academic performance\n\n---\n\n## THE SOPHISTICATION QUESTION\n\n**Are female predators more sophisticated than male predators?**\n\n**No.**\n\n**They're equally calculating.**\n\n**But they exploit different vulnerabilities and operate within different cultural contexts.**\n\n**Male predators targeting female victims often use:**\n\n- Physical intimidation\n\n- Threats\n\n- Coercion\n\n- Isolation through fear\n\n**Female predators targeting male victims often use:**\n\n- Status elevation\n\n- Material grooming\n\n- Cultural scripts about male sexuality\n\n- Protective framing to prevent disclosure\n\n**Female predators targeting female victims often use:**\n\n- Emotional intimacy\n\n- Professional authority\n\n- Same sex trust dynamics\n\n- Pastoral care frameworks\n\n**All are predatory.**\n\n**All cause serious harm.**\n\n**All exploit power differentials.**\n\n**The tactics differ because the opportunities differ.**\n\n---\n\n## CASE STUDY: THE BAIL PERIOD\n\nRebecca Joynes's offending while on bail illustrates predator adaptability.\n\n**After being arrested for offences against Boy A, she:**\n\n- Was suspended from teaching\n\n- Placed on bail\n\n- Subject to safeguarding restrictions\n\n**Despite these constraints, she targeted Boy B.**\n\n**This demonstrates:**\n\n**1. Predatory drive overrides consequences**\n\nEven facing prosecution, Joynes continued offending.\n\nThis isn't impulsive behaviour. It's compulsive predation.\n\n**2. Protective framing creates operational space**\n\nA male teacher on bail for child sexual abuse would face:\n\n- Community awareness\n\n- Social isolation\n\n- Intense scrutiny\n\n- Practical barriers to accessing victims\n\nJoynes was able to continue because protective framing created doubt:\n\n\"Surely this is a misunderstanding\"\n\"She doesn't seem like that type of person\"\n\"Maybe the first allegation was false\"\n\n**3. Tactical flexibility**\n\nUnable to access victims through her teaching position, Joynes adapted.\n\nShe didn't stop offending.\n\n**She found a different victim.**\n\n**Predators don't stop because they're caught.**\n\n**They stop when they can't access victims.**\n\n---\n\n## THE HARM IS IDENTICAL\n\n**This analysis of tactical differences is not suggesting:**\n\n- Male victims are harmed less than female victims\n\n- Female perpetrated abuse is less serious\n\n- Different tactics mean different levels of trauma\n\n**The harm of child sexual abuse is profound regardless of:**\n\n- Perpetrator gender\n\n- Victim gender\n\n- Grooming tactics used\n\n**What differs is:**\n\n- How victims are groomed\n\n- How abuse is concealed\n\n- How disclosure is prevented\n\n- How society responds\n\n**Understanding tactical differences improves:**\n\n- Recognition of warning signs\n\n- Support for victims\n\n- Prevention frameworks\n\n- Institutional response\n\n---\n\n## WHAT THE CASES REVEAL ABOUT PREDATOR THINKING\n\n### **Rebecca Joynes: The Material Grooming**\n\nThe £345 belt wasn't generosity.\n\n**It was:**\n\n- A test of boundaries (will he accept expensive gifts?)\n\n- Creation of obligation (he owes her something)\n\n- A marker of selection (you're special)\n\n- Plausible deniability (I was just being nice)\n\n**This is calculated predation.**\n\n---\n\n### **Catherine Pearl: The Positional Grooming**\n\nUsing her role as deputy head to access and abuse a vulnerable student wasn't opportunistic.\n\n**It was:**\n\n- Strategic use of institutional trust\n\n- Exploitation of legitimate access\n\n- Concealment within professional duties\n\n- Protection through authority\n\n**This is calculated predation.**\n\n---\n\n## THE PROBLEM WITH GENDER SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDING\n\n**Current safeguarding frameworks often assume:**\n\n- Male predators are the primary threat\n\n- Female staff are inherently safer\n\n- Boys are less vulnerable than girls\n\n- Same sex abuse (particularly female perpetrator, female victim) is rare\n\n**These assumptions create gaps:**\n\n**Gap 1: Male victims are invisible**\n\nIf safeguarding focuses on protecting girls from men, boys abused by women fall outside the framework.\n\n**Gap 2: Female perpetrators are trusted**\n\nIf women are presumed safe, warning signs are missed or explained away.\n\n**Gap 3: Tactical diversity isn't recognised**\n\nIf we only train staff to spot male predator tactics, female predator tactics go unnoticed.\n\n**Gap 4: Same sex abuse is minimised**\n\nIf we assume sexual abuse is primarily heterosexual male perpetrator, female victim, then female on female abuse is conceptually invisible.\n\n---\n\n## BREAKING THE TACTICAL BLIND SPOT\n\n**Effective safeguarding requires:**\n\n### **1. Gender neutral frameworks**\n\nWarning signs should focus on behaviours, not perpetrator demographics:\n\n- Is there boundary violation?\n\n- Is there inappropriate gift giving?\n\n- Is there isolation of the victim?\n\n- Is there excessive one on one contact?\n\n- Is there secrecy?\n\n**These questions work regardless of staff gender.**\n\n---\n\n### **2. Recognition of tactical diversity**\n\nTraining should include:\n\n- Material grooming patterns\n\n- Emotional grooming patterns\n\n- Status elevation tactics\n\n- Professional role exploitation\n\n- Different disclosure barriers for different victim genders\n\n---\n\n### **3. Institutional courage**\n\nSchools must be willing to:\n\n- Investigate concerns about female staff\n\n- Respond to reports from male victims\n\n- Address same sex abuse\n\n- Act despite reputational concerns\n\n**Catherine Pearl abused a student for years while serving as deputy head.**\n\n**Institutional structures failed to detect or stop her.**\n\n**Not because the warning signs weren't there.**\n\n**Because we weren't looking for them in a female deputy head.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT VICTIMS NEED US TO UNDERSTAND\n\n### **For male victims of female perpetrators:**\n\n**Your abuse is real.**\n\nThe protective framing that tells you \"you're lucky\" is wrong.\n\nThe cultural scripts that say \"boys can't be victims of women\" are false.\n\nThe harm you experienced is as serious as any other child sexual abuse.\n\n**You deserved protection.**\n\n**You deserve support now.**\n\n---\n\n### **For female victims of female perpetrators:**\n\n**Your abuse is real.**\n\nThe fact that your abuser was female doesn't make it less serious.\n\nThe confusion you felt about a trusted female authority figure harming you is a normal response to abnormal circumstances.\n\nThe difficulty in naming what happened doesn't mean it didn't happen.\n\n**You deserved protection.**\n\n**You deserve support now.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT COMES NEXT\n\nIn **Part 4**, we'll investigate the sentencing gap: why Rebecca Joynes received 6.5 years while Catherine Pearl received 2 years 4 months, and what comparative analysis of sentences reveals about protective framing in courtrooms.\n\nIn **Part 5**, we'll examine prevention: what these cases teach us about recognition, response, and building safeguarding frameworks that actually protect children regardless of perpetrator gender.\n\n**Different tactics.**\n\n**Same predation.**\n\n**Equal harm.**\n\n**We need safeguarding that sees all of it.**\n\n---\n\n## SOURCES & VERIFICATION\n\nAll facts in this article are drawn from:\n\n**Catherine Pearl case:**\n\n- BBC News, 27 January 2025\n\n- BBC News, 30 July 2025\n\n- Court of Appeal judgement, July 2025\n\n- Thames Valley Police statements\n\n**Rebecca Joynes case:**\n\n- Crown Prosecution Service press release, 4 July 2024\n\n- Manchester Crown Court proceedings, May 2024\n\n**Research on grooming tactics:**\n\n- Academic literature on gender differences in child sexual abuse perpetration\n\n- Safeguarding guidance from NSPCC, Stop It Now UK\n\n- Research on male victimisation and disclosure barriers\n\n---\n\n## RESOURCES & SUPPORT\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this article:\n\n**Stop It Now UK** – Confidential helpline for preventing child sexual abuse\nhttps://www.stopitnow.org.uk\n\n**NAPAC** – Support for adult survivors of childhood abuse\nhttps://napac.org.uk\n\n**Survivors UK** – Support for male survivors\nhttps://www.survivorsuk.org\n\n**The Survivors Trust** – Specialist support services\nhttps://www.thesurvivorstrust.org\n\n**If a child is at immediate risk:**\nUK: Call 999 (emergency) or 101 (non-emergency)\n\n---\n\n## ABOUT THIS RESEARCH\n\nThis article is based exclusively on publicly available court documents, official statements from the Crown Prosecution Service and police forces, verified media reporting from established news outlets (BBC, official court reporters), and Court of Appeal judgements.

The findings expose a prison healthcare system that routinely fails to meet basic clinical standards for one of the most manageable neurological conditions.\n\nThe PPO’s Learning Lessons Bulletin, published 24th November analysed 125 deaths over the past decade where prisoners either died from epilepsy or had an epilepsy diagnosis at the time of their death. The statistics are stark: sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for 0.64% of prison deaths, compared to just 0.15% in the general population. This four-fold disparity cannot be explained by demographics alone.\n\n---\n\n## **A System in Crisis**\n\nThe research paints a picture of institutional neglect that begins at reception and continues through every stage of a prisoner’s journey through the system. Of the 37 cases where epilepsy was directly implicated in death, 11% of prisoners had never received a formal diagnosis — despite taking anti-seizure medication and being widely recognised as having the condition.\n\n“We found examples where prisoners were receiving medication for seizures and it was widely considered they had epilepsy, yet they never received a formal diagnosis,” the report states. “In some cases, healthcare teams could have done more to determine whether the prisoner had epilepsy.”\n\nThe implications are profound. Without a formal diagnosis, prisoners cannot access appropriate specialist care, their seizure triggers cannot be properly identified, and their risk factors for SUDEP remain unassessed. It is healthcare by assumption, not assessment.\n\n---\n\n## **The Care Plan Crisis**\n\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines are unambiguous: every person with epilepsy should have a documented care plan. In the community, this is standard practice. In prison, the PPO found that only 38% of prisoners with an epilepsy diagnosis had a documented care plan.\n\nA care plan is not administrative box-ticking. It contains life-saving information: what triggers a prisoner’s seizures, what medication they take, what emergency protocols should be followed, and when rescue medication should be administered. Without this document, prison officers responding to a seizure are operating blind.\n\nThe report documents case after case where this absence proved fatal. In one instance, an officer responding to reports of a prisoner having a seizure decided the man was simply sleeping. The prisoner died. The prison’s own policy stated that epileptic seizures required an emergency code blue response. Had a care plan been available and communicated to wing staff, the outcome might have been different.\n\n---\n\n## **Seizure Control: A Devastating Comparison**\n\nPerhaps the most alarming finding concerns seizure control rates. The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 70% of people with epilepsy could live seizure-free with proper treatment. A 2004 UK study found that 51.7% of people with epilepsy in the community had not experienced a seizure in the preceding year.\n\nIn prison, the picture is starkly different. The PPO found that only 18% of the deceased prisoners in their sample had been seizure-free in the past year. More recent research cited in the bulletin found seizure-free rates as low as 0.2% among prisoners with epilepsy.\n\n“The poor seizure control rate among the sample may suggest that these prisoners could have benefited from specialist input and a review of their treatment.”\n\nThis is not a marginal difference. It represents a complete failure to provide care equivalent to that available in the community — a legal requirement for prison healthcare. When clinical reviewers assessed equivalence of care, only 58% of cases were found to meet this standard.\n\n---\n\n## **The Transfer Death Trap**\n\nPrison transfers emerge as a particular danger point. Of the 125 deaths analysed, 32% of prisoners had transferred prisons in the 12 months before their death. More critically, 22% of those who died directly from epilepsy did so within days or weeks of arriving at a new prison.\n\nThe report details multiple failures during transfers: prisoners arriving without their medication, care plans not being communicated, specialist appointments missed because receiving prisons were never informed. In one case, a prisoner transferred without several critical medications and missed a consultant epilepsy review that had been booked at his previous prison. He died 12 days after arriving at his new facility.\n\nPrison Service Order 3050 explicitly requires that information on continuing care be conveyed to receiving prisons on transfer. The evidence suggests this requirement is routinely ignored.\n\n---\n\n## **Mental Health: The Hidden Complication**\n\nThe intersection of epilepsy and mental health emerges as a critical concern. Fully 74% of the prisoners in the PPO’s sample had a diagnosed mental health condition, with depression (54%) and anxiety (30%) being most common. This is not merely a comorbidity — it directly impacts epilepsy outcomes.\n\nResearch demonstrates that stress can trigger seizures and increase fatality risk. In 75% of the cases reviewed, prisoners had experienced stress related to imprisonment — worrying about cell transfers, separation from family or upcoming sentencing. For people with epilepsy, the prison environment itself becomes a medical risk factor.\n\nThe suicide statistics are particularly troubling. Among prisoners with epilepsy who died of causes other than their condition, 34% died by suicide — compared to 26% of all prison deaths over the same period. External research has found people with epilepsy are twice as likely to die by suicide as those without. Yet the report questions whether epilepsy diagnosis is even considered a risk factor in prison suicide prevention.\n\nOne case study illustrates how these factors converge lethally. A woman prescribed clonazepam for seizures had her medication reduced by a prison GP concerned about benzodiazepine dependency. The decision caused her “considerable distress” — she worried about experiencing seizures. She was placed on suicide prevention monitoring, but no healthcare staff participated in the process. The GP who reviewed her medication on the day of her death was unaware she was on suicide watch. She died by hanging.\n\n---\n\n## **Substance Use: A Compounding Risk**\n\n65% of prisoners in the sample had a history of substance use — a known risk factor for both seizures and SUDEP. The report found “some indication of seizures not being taken as seriously where the individual used substances”, with staff in some cases failing to follow local protocols.\n\nThis is a dangerous conflation. A seizure is a medical emergency regardless of the patient’s history with drugs or alcohol. Yet the evidence suggests prison staff may be dismissing genuine seizure activity as drug-related behaviour, with fatal consequences.\n\nOne prisoner’s illicit drug use increased alongside his seizure frequency after a transfer. While he was warned about medication non-compliance and referred to substance misuse services, “it was not clear that he was warned that non-compliance with medication, alongside substance use, potentially increased his risk of SUDEP.” He died from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.\n\n---\n\n## **Medication Non-Adherence: Protocols Without Practice**\n\nOnly 34% of prisoners in the sample were taking their medication as prescribed. 28% were not, and for 37% the situation was unclear. Non-adherence to anti-seizure medication is a recognised risk factor for SUDEP — yet the report found medication refusal protocols were inconsistently applied.\n\nOne case is particularly damning. A prisoner repeatedly refused his epilepsy medication and experienced regular seizures. The healthcare provider’s protocol required a GP review after five consecutive refusals, with earlier intervention for critical medications. “While healthcare staff sometimes followed this, GP appointments were not always made where this threshold was met.” The clinical reviewer considered the man’s medication “critical to managing his epilepsy.” He died from SUDEP.\n\nIn the same case, supervised medication was arranged following concerns — yet the nurse admitted that on the morning of the prisoner’s death, “he did not check [the prisoner] had taken his medication before he left the cell.” Protocols exist on paper. Their implementation is another matter.\n\n---\n\n## **Cell Arrangements: The Single-Cell Paradox**\n\nNICE guidelines identify sleeping alone without supervision as a risk factor for SUDEP. Yet the PPO found that 69% of prisoners with epilepsy were housed in single cells. Some prisons have policies explicitly preventing prisoners with epilepsy from cell-sharing — ostensibly to avoid placing responsibility on other prisoners.\n\nThe irony is grim. The very arrangement intended to protect prisoners may be contributing to their deaths. A cellmate can raise the alarm when a seizure occurs. A prisoner alone in a cell during a nocturnal seizure has no such safety net.\n\nThe report also documents prisoners with epilepsy being placed on top bunks despite healthcare requests for lower bunk allocation — an arrangement that increases injury risk during seizures.\n\n---\n\n## **The Human Cost**\n\nBehind every statistic is a person who died in state custody, often from a condition that is largely manageable with proper care. The case studies throughout the PPO’s report are not complex medical mysteries. They are stories of missed appointments, unfollowed protocols, failures of communication and institutional indifference.\n\nA man who reported feeling “something coming on” after a stressful prison transfer was told he didn’t need urgent help. He was found unresponsive hours later. A woman whose medication change caused her severe anxiety had no healthcare involvement in her suicide prevention monitoring. A prisoner whose seizure frequency increased received no plan to monitor his condition. All died preventable deaths.\n\nThe PPO states it will work with NHS England and HMPPS to develop actions improving epilepsy care in prisons. The report’s recommendations are sensible but hardly revolutionary: ensure care plans exist, follow medication protocols, transfer prisoners with their medication, communicate with receiving healthcare teams, don’t put people with seizures on top bunks.\n\nThat such basic recommendations need to be made in 2025 tells us everything about the state of prison healthcare. The question now is whether the institutions responsible will treat this report as a call to action — or another document to be filed and forgotten while prisoners continue to die.\n\n---\n\n## **Diversity and Demographics**\n\nAll prisoners in the groups where epilepsy was a primary or secondary cause of death were male. In the broader sample, 7.9% were female. The age distribution showed 32% of deaths occurred in prisoners aged 41–50, with 21% aged 31–40 and 10% aged 21–30.\n\nA notable racial disparity emerged in the deaths directly caused by epilepsy: 24% of these deaths involved Black or Black British prisoners, despite this group comprising around 12% of the prison population. However, when all three categories were combined, Black or Black British prisoners represented 7% of deaths. The PPO does not speculate on reasons for this disparity, but it warrants further investigation.\n\n---\n\n## **What Happens Next**\n\nThe PPO has committed to ongoing work with NHS England and HMPPS. Key areas identified for further exploration include: the appropriateness of prison transfers for some prisoners with epilepsy, the use of medical holds, seizure monitoring and recording systems, information sharing between healthcare and operational staff, and policies around cell-sharing.\n\nFor the 125 people whose deaths informed this report, these improvements come too late. For the thousands of prisoners currently living with epilepsy in British prisons, the question is whether this bulletin will finally force systemic change — or whether it will join the long list of ignored warnings about the fatal consequences of institutional neglect.\n\nThe full PPO Learning Lessons Bulletin on Epilepsy is available at [www.ppo.gov.uk](http://www.ppo.gov.uk)\n\n---","src/content/articles/dying-behind-bars-how-britains-prisons-are-failing-people-with-epilepsy.md","7802ba4a37cb4be7",{"html":1239,"metadata":1240},"\u003Cp>©️ \u003Cem>By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files | November\u003C/em> 2025\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/file_00000000f710720a895a605f7031a71a7e22403232904678015701.jpg?w=495\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A damning new report from the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman reveals that prisoners with epilepsy are dying at alarming rates, with systemic failures in diagnosis, care planning and emergency response contributing to preventable deaths. The findings expose a prison healthcare system that routinely fails to meet basic clinical standards for one of the most manageable neurological conditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The PPO’s Learning Lessons Bulletin, published 24th November analysed 125 deaths over the past decade where prisoners either died from epilepsy or had an epilepsy diagnosis at the time of their death. The statistics are stark: sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for 0.64% of prison deaths, compared to just 0.15% in the general population. This four-fold disparity cannot be explained by demographics alone.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"a-system-in-crisis\">\u003Cstrong>A System in Crisis\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The research paints a picture of institutional neglect that begins at reception and continues through every stage of a prisoner’s journey through the system. Of the 37 cases where epilepsy was directly implicated in death, 11% of prisoners had never received a formal diagnosis — despite taking anti-seizure medication and being widely recognised as having the condition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“We found examples where prisoners were receiving medication for seizures and it was widely considered they had epilepsy, yet they never received a formal diagnosis,” the report states. “In some cases, healthcare teams could have done more to determine whether the prisoner had epilepsy.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The implications are profound. Without a formal diagnosis, prisoners cannot access appropriate specialist care, their seizure triggers cannot be properly identified, and their risk factors for SUDEP remain unassessed. It is healthcare by assumption, not assessment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-care-plan-crisis\">\u003Cstrong>The Care Plan Crisis\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines are unambiguous: every person with epilepsy should have a documented care plan. In the community, this is standard practice. In prison, the PPO found that only 38% of prisoners with an epilepsy diagnosis had a documented care plan.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A care plan is not administrative box-ticking. It contains life-saving information: what triggers a prisoner’s seizures, what medication they take, what emergency protocols should be followed, and when rescue medication should be administered. Without this document, prison officers responding to a seizure are operating blind.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The report documents case after case where this absence proved fatal. In one instance, an officer responding to reports of a prisoner having a seizure decided the man was simply sleeping. The prisoner died. The prison’s own policy stated that epileptic seizures required an emergency code blue response. Had a care plan been available and communicated to wing staff, the outcome might have been different.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"seizure-control-a-devastating-comparison\">\u003Cstrong>Seizure Control: A Devastating Comparison\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Perhaps the most alarming finding concerns seizure control rates. The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 70% of people with epilepsy could live seizure-free with proper treatment. A 2004 UK study found that 51.7% of people with epilepsy in the community had not experienced a seizure in the preceding year.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In prison, the picture is starkly different. The PPO found that only 18% of the deceased prisoners in their sample had been seizure-free in the past year. More recent research cited in the bulletin found seizure-free rates as low as 0.2% among prisoners with epilepsy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“The poor seizure control rate among the sample may suggest that these prisoners could have benefited from specialist input and a review of their treatment.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is not a marginal difference. It represents a complete failure to provide care equivalent to that available in the community — a legal requirement for prison healthcare. When clinical reviewers assessed equivalence of care, only 58% of cases were found to meet this standard.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-transfer-death-trap\">\u003Cstrong>The Transfer Death Trap\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Prison transfers emerge as a particular danger point. Of the 125 deaths analysed, 32% of prisoners had transferred prisons in the 12 months before their death. More critically, 22% of those who died directly from epilepsy did so within days or weeks of arriving at a new prison.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The report details multiple failures during transfers: prisoners arriving without their medication, care plans not being communicated, specialist appointments missed because receiving prisons were never informed. In one case, a prisoner transferred without several critical medications and missed a consultant epilepsy review that had been booked at his previous prison. He died 12 days after arriving at his new facility.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Prison Service Order 3050 explicitly requires that information on continuing care be conveyed to receiving prisons on transfer. The evidence suggests this requirement is routinely ignored.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"mental-health-the-hidden-complication\">\u003Cstrong>Mental Health: The Hidden Complication\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The intersection of epilepsy and mental health emerges as a critical concern. Fully 74% of the prisoners in the PPO’s sample had a diagnosed mental health condition, with depression (54%) and anxiety (30%) being most common. This is not merely a comorbidity — it directly impacts epilepsy outcomes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Research demonstrates that stress can trigger seizures and increase fatality risk. In 75% of the cases reviewed, prisoners had experienced stress related to imprisonment — worrying about cell transfers, separation from family or upcoming sentencing. For people with epilepsy, the prison environment itself becomes a medical risk factor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The suicide statistics are particularly troubling.

This research is conducted independently with full informed consent protocols and trauma-informed methodology. Over three years, Sophie has documented a previously unrecognised offender pattern: exposure-seeking behaviour in individuals with concerning sexual ideation about children.\n\n---\n\n## Timeline of Events\n\n**October 2023**: Eddie B's case begins with Greater Manchester Police\n\n**January 2024**: Case referred to CPS (after 3 months with police)\n\n**June 2025**: First documented case (Matt) contacts Sophie voluntarily\n\n**August 2025**: Eddie contacts Sophie voluntarily — **20 months into CPS review, 22 months total investigation** — claiming allegations of \"receiving inappropriate images of children, and sending inappropriate images of children. Upskirting.\"\n\n**August 2025**: Full interview conducted with informed consent and signed contract\n\n**October 2025**: Eddie receives **No Further Action (NFA)** — after **24 months under investigation** (21 months with CPS)\n\n**October 2025**: Matt observed continuing online searches consistent with his previous behavioural pattern\n\n**October 29, 2025**: GMP confirms they cannot verify details without additional identifiers beyond his name\n\n---\n\n## The Weight of 24 Months\n\nEddie didn't reach out to me in a moment of panic. He contacted me **nearly two years deep** into an investigation that had been with CPS for **20 months**.\n\nTo put that in context: **average CPS review timelines are 3-6 months**. Eddie's case took **21 months with CPS alone**.\n\nThis wasn't impulsive confession. This was **calculated approach** during active CPS proceedings.\n\nHe knew he was under investigation.\nHe knew CPS had been reviewing his case for over a year and a half.\n**He reached out anyway.**\n\n---\n\n## What NFA Means After 21 Months with CPS\n\nWhen CPS holds a case for **21 months** before deciding No Further Action, that's extraordinary.\n\nStandard CPS review timelines are weeks to months, not nearly two years.\n\n**21 months with CPS typically indicates:**\n\n- **Complex digital evidence** requiring extensive forensic analysis\n\n- **Multiple devices or accounts** being examined\n\n- **Cross-jurisdictional complications**\n\n- **Borderline threshold decisions** — evidence exists but charging standard not met\n\n- **Ongoing investigation** whilst CPS advises police on additional evidence needed\n\n**What it doesn't mean:**\nThat the case was trivial. That nothing was found. That no risk exists.\n\n**CPS doesn't sit on cases for 21 months over nothing.**\n\n---\n\n## The Compulsion to Confess — 20 Months Into CPS Review\n\nThe most significant aspect of Eddie's case isn't the NFA.\n\n**It's that he sought journalist exposure whilst CPS was actively reviewing his case for nearly two years.**\n\nIn August 2025 — with his case **still under CPS consideration** — Eddie:\n\n- Volunteered explicit details about sexual fantasies involving schoolgirls\n\n- Described recurring arousal at school uniforms (\"feeling can come back sometimes when I see schoolgirls\")\n\n- Admitted his \"darkest thought\": \"having sex with a schoolgirl in uniform and other things\"\n\n- Revealed visits to a dominatrix for punishment over \"nawty feelings\"\n\n- Confirmed speaking to me gives him the same \"rush\": **\"Yes\"**\n\n- Stated his greatest fear is **\"people finding out\"** — not prison\n\n**He couldn't stop himself from seeking exposure with CPS proceedings 20 months in.**\n\nThis is textbook exposure-seeking compulsion.\n\n---\n\n## What Takes 21 Months at CPS?\n\nBetween January 2024 and October 2025, what was CPS reviewing?\n\n**The timeline itself tells a story:**\n\n- **Months 1-6**: Initial evidence review, legal advice to police, potential further investigation requested\n\n- **Months 7-12**: Additional evidence gathered, re-reviewed, threshold assessments\n\n- **Months 13-18**: Borderline charging decisions, possibly seeking senior prosecutor review\n\n- **Months 19-21**: Final decision: evidence insufficient for realistic prospect of conviction\n\n**This wasn't a quick dismissal. This was prolonged consideration.**\n\nThe three stated allegations were:\n\n- Receiving inappropriate images of children\n\n- Sending inappropriate images of children\n\n- Upskirting\n\nFor CPS to spend 21 months on this means **something was there to review**.\n\n---\n\n## Why He Reached Out 20 Months In\n\nEddie's stated reason: to help me \"expose people who prey on children online.\"\n\n**The reality:**\nAfter 20 months of CPS review, with the outcome still uncertain, **he needed the exposure-shame cycle**.\n\nThe investigation alone wasn't providing it.

It reinforces it.\n\n---\n\n## THE ACCOUNTABILITY GAP\n\nWhen I attempted to verify Eddie's claims with Greater Manchester Police, I hit a wall that survivors and journalists know well:\n\n> \n> *\"Unfortunately, only a name isn't enough and we are unable to do anything without that extra information.\"*\n> — GMP Media Officer, October 29, 2025\n> \n> \n> \n\n**Translation**: Without the very details a subject controls (date of birth, crime reference number), verification is impossible.\n\n**This means:**\n\n- Subjects can claim investigation status without accountability\n\n- Journalists cannot verify claims that could inform public safety\n\n- The public has no way to know if NFA means \"innocent\" or \"insufficient evidence\"\n\n- Survivors seeking information face identical barriers\n\n**This isn't just an inconvenience. It's a structural barrier to transparency in cases involving potential risk to children.**\n\nThe system protects process over protection. Form over function. Privacy over prevention.\n\n**Meanwhile:**\n\nA man who spent 24 months under investigation for allegations relating to indecent-image offences:\n\n- Admits recurring sexual arousal at schoolgirls in uniform\n\n- Describes explicit fantasies about \"schoolgirls in uniform and other things\"\n\n- Seeks punishment and exposure as eroticised relief\n\n- **Compulsively approached a journalist mid-investigation**\n\n**And I cannot verify a single detail through official channels.**\n\n---\n\n## What the System Can't See\n\nAfter 24 months of investigation, 21 months with CPS, and an NFA outcome:\n\n**Eddie walks away with:**\n\n- No charges\n\n- No monitoring\n\n- No intervention\n\n- No therapy requirement\n\n- No restriction\n\n- No record that follows him\n\n**Despite admitting:**\n\n- Recurring sexual arousal at schoolgirls in uniform\n\n- Explicit fantasies about \"schoolgirls in uniform and other things\"\n\n- Seeking punishment and exposure as eroticised relief\n\n- Compulsive approach to journalist during active CPS review\n\n- Fear of exposure greater than fear of prison\n\n- That confession gives him arousal: \"Yes\"\n\n**The system says: case closed.**\n\n**The risk markers say: pattern active.**\n\n---\n\n## The Unanswered Questions\n\n**What evidence sustained a 21-month CPS review?**\nWe don't know. But CPS doesn't review baseless allegations for nearly two years.\n\n**What was found but deemed insufficient?**\nLikely below charging threshold — but \"insufficient to charge\" ≠ \"nothing there.\"\n\n**Why the extraordinary timeline?**\nComplex evidence, borderline decisions, or ongoing parallel investigations?\n\n**What happens now?**\nEddie is free. The compulsion remains. No system is watching.\n\n**Will it escalate?**\nMatt's case suggests exposure doesn't break the cycle — it reinforces it.\n\n---\n\n## What Should Change\n\nThis research identifies a clear gap in current safeguarding approaches. The following recommendations are evidence-based and actionable:\n\n### 1. **Pre-Offence Psychological Risk Assessment Protocols**\n\nIndividuals who exhibit exposure-seeking behaviour, shame-arousal cycles, and persistent sexual ideation about children should trigger assessment pathways — **regardless of whether charges are brought**.\n\n### 2. **Mandatory Referral Pathways for Exposure-Seeking Behaviour**\n\nWhen individuals compulsively seek confession, punishment, or exposure related to sexual thoughts about children, this should be recognised as a **risk marker requiring intervention**, not dismissed as \"just thoughts.\"\n\n### 3. **CPS Guidance on Behavioural Red Flags**\n\nCases that result in NFA after extended review due to insufficient evidence should include **risk assessment and safeguarding referral protocols** — especially when behavioural indicators are present.\n\n### 4. **Research Funding for Exposure-Seeking Offender Typology**\n\nThis pattern has been independently documented across multiple cases. It requires:\n\n- Academic research validation\n\n- Development of screening tools\n\n- Evidence-based intervention protocols\n\n- Training for police, CPS, and safeguarding professionals\n\n### 5. **Transparency in NFA Decisions**\n\nPublic interest cases involving allegations relating to indecent-image offences should include:\n\n- Anonymised statistics on NFA reasons\n\n- Distinction between \"no evidence\" and \"insufficient evidence\"\n\n- Safeguarding outcome tracking\n\n**Without these changes, individuals like Eddie and Matt will continue to fall through every gap — until they don't.**\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe system operates on binaries: **charged** or **NFA'd**.\n\nThere is no category for individuals who:\n\n- Spent 24 months under investigation\n\n- Admit persistent sexual ideation about children\n\n- Seek exposure compulsively during official proceedings\n\n- Eroticise shame and punishment\n\n- Cannot self-regulate even under CPS scrutiny\n\n**Eddie represents what falls through every gap:**\n\nNot charged = not an offender\nAdmits urges = not \"safe\"\nSeeks exposure = not hiding\n**= No framework exists**\n\n---\n\n## The Research Continues\n\n**Three years. Three documented cases. Same pattern. Zero institutional response.**\n\nI have attempted to engage:\n\n- Criminology departments\n\n- Forensic psychology researchers\n\n- Child protection bodies\n\n- Police research units\n\n**I have been largely ignored.**\n\nThis is survivor-led, trauma-informed investigative journalism conducted with:\n\n- Full informed consent protocols\n\n- Signed contracts with all participants\n\n- Trauma-informed interview methodology\n\n- Ethical safeguarding throughout\n\n**I am not a vigilante. I am documenting a risk pattern the system refuses to acknowledge.**\n\nEddie's 24-month investigation ending in NFA doesn't invalidate these findings.\n\n**It proves the system can stare at this pattern for two years and still not see it.**\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**The system spent 24 months investigating Eddie.**\n**I spent 90 minutes interviewing him.**\n\nIn that time, he admitted:\n\n- Recurring sexual arousal at schoolgirls in uniform\n\n- Explicit fantasies he describes as his \"darkest thoughts\"\n\n- Compulsive need for exposure and punishment\n\n- That speaking to me gives him the same rush as paid domination sessions\n\nThe system concluded: **No Further Action.**\nThe pattern concluded: **Still active.**\n\n**How many more Eddies are out there, cycling through shame and arousal, waiting for someone to notice before they cross the line?**\n\n**And how many children will pay the price whilst we wait for the system to catch up to what it refuses to see?**\n\n---\n\n## Right of Reply\n\n- Greater Manchester Police confirmed they cannot verify details without DOB or crime reference\n\n- Eddie B was contacted for comment; no response received\n\n- Any subject named may submit a formal response for publication\n\n---\n\n## Contact\n\nFor research collaboration, professional consultation, or if you are a forensic psychologist, criminologist, or child protection professional interested in these findings:\n\n**sophie.editorial@outlook.com**\n\n---\n\n*Published by Sophie Editorial | Independent Freelance Journalist ❤️*","src/content/articles/eddie-b-update-24-months-under-investigation-the-nfa-that-raises-more-questions-than-answers.md","25f8a6fda8b91fde",{"html":1302,"metadata":1303},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>© By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_000000005da862439915e568e68f8fca8329916047652796592.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>About This Research\u003C/strong>\nSophie Lewis is a final-year BA (Hons) Social Sciences student specialising in criminology, forensic psychology, and counselling.

It is written in good faith, in the public interest, and with the intention of protecting vulnerable individuals from potential harm. All individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, and any corrections will be issued if new evidence arises.\n\nWhen I joined *The Masked Truth* on March 19th, I expected to be part of a group rooted in advocacy, truth-telling, and justice for vulnerable people. What I found instead was something darker: a pattern of manipulation, exploitation, and abuse hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe group was founded in April 2023 by a man who calls himself **Dan Brown**, also known online as **Daniel Murray**. His real name, however, is **David Barker**. Based in South Shields, Barker presents himself as an advocate for victims, particularly those fighting in the family courts. But through personal observation and multiple accounts shared confidentially, serious concerns have emerged around his conduct.\n\n---\n\n### **THE PATTERN**\n\nSince its inception, *The Masked Truth* has attracted many women facing immense personal battles: survivors of domestic abuse, mothers in family court, women with trauma, mental health conditions, and neurodivergent diagnoses like ASD and ADHD. These are individuals seeking help, solidarity, and safety.\n\nInstead, according to a pattern observed by multiple members and others connected to the group, many were met with inappropriate and harmful conduct.\n\nOver time, it became apparent that Barker was developing personal and sometimes romantic entanglements with a number of vulnerable individuals connected to the group. In one case, he maintained contact with someone for months, building emotional intimacy online. Shortly after, he was allegedly involved with another person within the same circle. These overlapping dynamics created tension, confusion, and emotional fallout for those involved.\n\nA former member I spoke with privately described him as dangerous, manipulative, and calculated. The charm, she explained, was a mask. The kindness, a hook. Once she saw behind it, everything changed.\n\nOthers, speaking off-record, have echoed similar sentiments. They have since distanced themselves entirely from both the group and Barker.\n\n---\n\n### **CONTROL AND DOCUMENT WITHHOLDING**\n\n*The Masked Truth* claims to help members with social services and family court issues. One woman, referred to here as Lacey (name changed for protection), privately shared that she trusted Dan with her **Subject Access Request (SAR)** documents — sensitive files containing personal and legal information. She handed them over believing it was part of the group’s support process.\n\nIt is understood that those documents were never returned. She says Barker initially promised to return them in person, but then blocked her on all platforms. It is further alleged he later denied ever having them. If true, these actions could severely impact her legal standing and personal safety.\n\n---\n\n### **DISTURBING SEXUAL CLAIMS**\n\nA former team member has privately alleged that Barker discussed being involved in **breath play**, including acts involving bags over women’s heads. Whether consensual or not, these acts carry serious psychological and physical risks, especially when occurring in contexts involving previously traumatised individuals. These claims remain unverified but are deeply concerning in light of other behavioural patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **BULLYING AND SILENCING**\n\nDuring my brief time in the group (I was removed on March 31st), I observed a toxic dynamic forming. One individual  – was bullying another vulnerable member with ASD and ADHD. Barker did not intervene. His lack of leadership or safeguarding appeared to enable the behaviour.\n\nWhen I personally challenged the bullying and stood up for the neurodivergent woman being targeted, I was promptly kicked from the group myself. That, more than anything, confirmed what I already suspected — this wasn’t a safe space.

It is written in good faith, in the public interest, and with the intention of protecting vulnerable individuals from potential harm. All individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, and any corrections will be issued if new evidence arises.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When I joined \u003Cem>The Masked Truth\u003C/em> on March 19th, I expected to be part of a group rooted in advocacy, truth-telling, and justice for vulnerable people. What I found instead was something darker: a pattern of manipulation, exploitation, and abuse hiding in plain sight.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The group was founded in April 2023 by a man who calls himself \u003Cstrong>Dan Brown\u003C/strong>, also known online as \u003Cstrong>Daniel Murray\u003C/strong>. His real name, however, is \u003Cstrong>David Barker\u003C/strong>. Based in South Shields, Barker presents himself as an advocate for victims, particularly those fighting in the family courts. But through personal observation and multiple accounts shared confidentially, serious concerns have emerged around his conduct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-pattern\">\u003Cstrong>THE PATTERN\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Since its inception, \u003Cem>The Masked Truth\u003C/em> has attracted many women facing immense personal battles: survivors of domestic abuse, mothers in family court, women with trauma, mental health conditions, and neurodivergent diagnoses like ASD and ADHD. These are individuals seeking help, solidarity, and safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Instead, according to a pattern observed by multiple members and others connected to the group, many were met with inappropriate and harmful conduct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Over time, it became apparent that Barker was developing personal and sometimes romantic entanglements with a number of vulnerable individuals connected to the group. In one case, he maintained contact with someone for months, building emotional intimacy online. Shortly after, he was allegedly involved with another person within the same circle. These overlapping dynamics created tension, confusion, and emotional fallout for those involved.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A former member I spoke with privately described him as dangerous, manipulative, and calculated. The charm, she explained, was a mask. The kindness, a hook. Once she saw behind it, everything changed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Others, speaking off-record, have echoed similar sentiments. They have since distanced themselves entirely from both the group and Barker.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"control-and-document-withholding\">\u003Cstrong>CONTROL AND DOCUMENT WITHHOLDING\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>The Masked Truth\u003C/em> claims to help members with social services and family court issues. One woman, referred to here as Lacey (name changed for protection), privately shared that she trusted Dan with her \u003Cstrong>Subject Access Request (SAR)\u003C/strong> documents — sensitive files containing personal and legal information. She handed them over believing it was part of the group’s support process.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is understood that those documents were never returned. She says Barker initially promised to return them in person, but then blocked her on all platforms. It is further alleged he later denied ever having them. If true, these actions could severely impact her legal standing and personal safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"disturbing-sexual-claims\">\u003Cstrong>DISTURBING SEXUAL CLAIMS\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>A former team member has privately alleged that Barker discussed being involved in \u003Cstrong>breath play\u003C/strong>, including acts involving bags over women’s heads. Whether consensual or not, these acts carry serious psychological and physical risks, especially when occurring in contexts involving previously traumatised individuals. These claims remain unverified but are deeply concerning in light of other behavioural patterns.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"bullying-and-silencing\">\u003Cstrong>BULLYING AND SILENCING\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>During my brief time in the group (I was removed on March 31st), I observed a toxic dynamic forming. One individual  – was bullying another vulnerable member with ASD and ADHD. Barker did not intervene. His lack of leadership or safeguarding appeared to enable the behaviour.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When I personally challenged the bullying and stood up for the neurodivergent woman being targeted, I was promptly kicked from the group myself. That, more than anything, confirmed what I already suspected — this wasn’t a safe space. It was a controlled space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/screenshot_20250406_220507_com_whatsapp_conversation_edit_496212562582058133540320932608395.jpg?w=555\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/screenshot_20250406_220537_com_whatsapp_conversation_edit_495777163684302629178545950508155.jpg?w=461\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/screenshot_20250406_220553_com_whatsapp_conversation_edit_495330302863645816815697588264814.jpg?w=461\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In private, it has been alleged that when concerns were raised internally about these dynamics, those individuals were met with deflection, blame, or removal.

Children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators, trafficked, beaten and intimidated.\n\nPolice officers called the victims **\"tarts\"** and **\"undesirables\"** — children they knew were being sexually exploited by adults.\n\nThe abuse wasn't hidden. It was reported. Victims were known to multiple agencies. Many were in care, repeatedly going missing, flagged as vulnerable.\n\nThe Jay Report found that **\"the police had shown a lack of respect for the victims in the early 2000s, deeming them 'undesirables' unworthy of police protection.\"**\n\nWhen professionals see children this way, intervention becomes optional.\n\n---\n\n## Oxford: \"Very Difficult Girls Making Bad Choices\"\n\nThe 2015 Serious Case Review into child sexual exploitation in Oxfordshire examined cases where girls as young as 11 were subjected to what one victim described as a **\"living hell\"**.\n\nThe official review found:\n\n**\"They were seen as very difficult girls making bad choices. That the girls had lost the ability to consent or make their own decisions due to grooming was not realised.\"**\n\n**\"The language used by professionals was one which saw the girls as the source not the victims of their extreme behaviour.\"**\n\nThe abuse continued for years. Seven men were convicted. Five received life sentences.\n\nThe victims had been screaming for help the entire time.\n\n---\n\n## Known to Services, Left There Anyway\n\nOne of the most consistent findings across grooming gang cases is this:\n\nVictims were already known to multiple agencies.\n\nMany were:\n\n- in care or on the edge of care\n\n- flagged for missing episodes\n\n- known to youth offending teams\n\n- identified as vulnerable\n\nThey weren't invisible children.\n\nThey were highly visible — just not prioritised.\n\nProfessionals knew these children were being harmed.\nWhat they didn't do was act decisively enough to stop it.\n\n---\n\n## Fear, Paralysis, and Reputation Management\n\nSo why didn't authorities intervene?\n\nThe reasons given are depressingly consistent:\n\n- fear of \"getting it wrong\"\n\n- concern about community tensions\n\n- uncertainty over evidential thresholds\n\n- belief that victims were unreliable\n\n- reluctance to escalate without a \"clear offence\"\n\nIn practice, this meant waiting.\n\nWaiting for stronger evidence.\nWaiting for the \"right\" moment.\nWaiting until the harm was undeniable.\n\nBy the time it was undeniable, the damage was already done.\n\n---\n\n## This Wasn't a Blind Spot — It Was a Choice\n\nCalling this a \"failure to spot abuse\" lets institutions off the hook.\n\nThe reality is harsher.\n\nAbuse was spotted — repeatedly.\nIt just wasn't acted on with the seriousness it demanded.\n\nThat isn't blindness.\n\nIt's a systemic decision to tolerate risk until it becomes unavoidable.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Still Matters\n\nGrooming gang cases are often framed as a problem of the past.\n\nThey're not.\n\nThe same mechanisms that allowed organised abuse to continue unchecked still exist:\n\n- risk reframing\n\n- victim credibility erosion\n\n- institutional fear culture\n\n- escalation paralysis\n\nDifferent setting.\nSame failure.\n\nSchools.\nCare homes.\nOnline spaces.\nPeer groups.\n\nWhen institutions prioritise reputation, process, or comfort over child protection, abuse doesn't need to hide.\n\nIt just needs to wait.\n\n---\n\n## What Comes Next\n\nIf we keep telling ourselves that grooming gangs \"went unnoticed\", we miss the real lesson.\n\nThe danger isn't that we don't see abuse.\n\nIt's that we see it — and convince ourselves it's someone else's problem.\n\nUntil that changes, new safeguarding bodies, new reviews, and new promises won't protect children.\n\nThey'll just explain, again, why nobody acted in time.\n\n---\n\n**Sophie Lewis | NUJ-Accredited

bullshit.\n\nFor years now, a very specific narrative has been pushed around grooming gangs in the UK — one that focuses almost exclusively on Asian or Muslim perpetrators, painting child sexual exploitation as something foreign, cultural, or imported. And leading that charge? The far-right’s poster boy, **Tommy Robinson** — a man who’s made a career, and a fortune, out of co-opting survivor stories to fuel racial hate and build his personal brand.\n\nBut as a white, British woman, and a survivor of grooming myself. I’m here to tell you: **it’s a lie. A distraction. And a disgrace.**\n\n---\n\n## **White Men Groom Too — You Just Don’t Hear About It**\n\nLet’s talk about the stats. You’ll hear people say things like “84% of grooming gang offenders are Asian,” but what they don’t tell you is that those figures come from selective, pre-framed studies based on **specific gang prosecutions**, not the wider landscape of child sexual abuse. In reality, **the vast majority of paedophiles, rapists, traffickers and abusers in the UK are white men.** Why? Because the UK is a majority white country.\n\nBut you don’t see Tommy running exposés on white grooming gangs, do you?\n\nWhere was the outrage over **Catholic Church abuse**, or the **VIP paedophile rings** linked to government officials, MPs, judges, and even royalty?\n\nWhere’s the national inquiry into **middle-class white dads sharing Dropbox folders of child abuse material**?\n\nYou won’t find it because **it doesn’t fit the agenda**.\n\n---\n\n## **The Real Agenda: Exploit, Distract, Divide**\n\nTommy Robinson didn’t “give survivors a voice.”\nHe **hijacked our pain** and turned it into political theatre.\n\nHe branded himself as a saviour while **using the stories of girls like us** to push anti-Muslim hate, attract donations, and sell merch. And now he’s riding high off the back of a “national inquiry” into grooming gangs that he didn’t cause, he simply *claimed* credit for a decades-long fight waged by *actual* survivors and advocates who never got airtime, because we weren’t controversial enough.\n\nThis isn’t justice.\n**It’s racial opportunism.**\n\n---\n\n## **Survivor-Led, Not Agenda-Led**\n\nAt **The Grooming Files**, I don’t cherry-pick which predators to expose based on skin colour or clickbait potential. I document *all* grooming. *All* abuse. No filter. No spin.\n\nI’ve exposed white offenders who were social workers, police officers, teachers, fathers, youth workers, and more. I've spoken to the predators themselves, pulled transcripts, confronted power, and faced the cost emotionally, legally, financially.\n\nAnd I’ve done it without needing to hijack movements or rile up mobs.\n\nBecause justice shouldn’t be political.\n**It should be universal.**\n\n---\n\n## **If You're Only Angry at Brown Offenders — You're Not Angry About Grooming**\n\nLet’s be brutally honest.\n\nIf your outrage only shows up when the abuser is brown, but you fall silent when he’s white, *you’re not angry about child abuse, you’re angry about race*.\n\nThat’s not activism.\nThat’s bigotry in survivor’s clothing.\n\nAnd while people scream about “Asian grooming gangs,” thousands of white children are being abused by white men behind closed doors, unnoticed, unreported, and unchallenged, because we’re too busy pushing someone else's agenda to see the bigger picture.\n\n---\n\n## **The Grooming Crisis Is Bigger Than Race — And We Know It**\n\nChild sexual abuse is systemic.\nIt spans **all races**, **all religions**, **all classes**.\n\nIt’s woven into institutions, covered up by councils, mishandled by police, and ignored by governments, because it’s inconvenient, messy, and doesn’t play well in the polls.\n\nWe will not let political grifters rewrite our stories.\nWe will not let survivor pain become campaign fuel.\n\n**We are taking our narrative back.**\n\n---\n\n## **You’re Not My Voice — And You Never Were**\n\nTo every Tommy-worshipper crying “he’s doing more than anyone else” ***wake the fuck up.***\n\nHe’s doing more damage than you realise. He’s made it harder for *real* survivor-led projects to get heard, funded, and taken seriously. He’s undermined our credibility, poisoned the space, and turned trauma into theatre.\n\nAnd to Tommy himself, if you’re reading this?\n\n**You’re not my voice. You never were.**\n\nI speak for myself.\nI speak for the survivors you never platformed.\nI speak for the girls who were groomed by white men, and never fit your script.\n\nThis is our story, not yours to sell.\n\n---","src/content/articles/hijacked-how-grooming-survivors-were-exploited-by-a-political-circus.md","8aacc1a4caa36e1e",{"html":1621,"metadata":1622},"\u003Cp>©️ By \u003Cstrong>Sophie Lewis\u003C/strong> | The Grooming Files | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_000000000d886246a51dde5b11e2dc228369999609599313761.png?w=683\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"lets-cut-through-the-bullshit\">Let’s cut through the bullshit.\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>For years now, a very specific narrative has been pushed around grooming gangs in the UK — one that focuses almost exclusively on Asian or Muslim perpetrators, painting child sexual exploitation as something foreign, cultural, or imported.

Identical Safeguarding Breakdown\n\nIn grooming gang cases, victims were known to services but dismissed.\n\nIn school abuse cases, warning signs were present but minimised.\n\nIn care homes, vulnerable children were flagged and left there anyway.\n\nThe details change.\nThe mechanism doesn't.\n\nAcross all of them, we see:\n\n- early indicators ignored\n\n- disclosures reframed or downgraded\n\n- escalation delayed\n\n- responsibility passed sideways\n\n- reputation quietly protected\n\nThis isn't coincidence.\n\nIt's pattern.\n\n---\n\n## St Anne's and Rotherham: The Same Pattern, Different Setting\n\n**St Anne's Catholic School, Southampton:**\n\nFour teachers. Sexual abuse spanning 2004-2022. Victims were pupils in positions of trust. The abuse occurred on school premises. Multiple cases. One was the headteacher.\n\n**Rotherham:**\n\nMultiple perpetrators. Sexual exploitation spanning 1997-2013. At least 1,400 victims. Girls as young as 11. Victims known to social services, police, care systems. Repeatedly going missing. Repeatedly reporting abuse.\n\n**The common thread:**\n\nIn both cases, victims were **known to multiple agencies**.\n\nIn both cases, there were **repeated opportunities to intervene**.\n\nIn both cases, **concerns were recorded but action was delayed**.\n\nSt Anne's: Professional boundaries violated in plain sight over 18 years.\n\nRotherham: Girls described abuse and were called \"undesirables\" making \"lifestyle choices\".\n\n**Different institutions. Different perpetrators. Identical safeguarding paralysis.**\n\n---\n\n## The Shared Anatomy of Failure\n\nWhether the abuse happened in a classroom, a flat, a care placement, or a car park, the same sequence repeats:\n\n- **A child shows distress or discloses harm**\n\n- **Professionals interpret rather than act**\n\n- **Risk is reframed as behaviour**\n\n- **Thresholds rise**\n\n- **Intervention stalls**\n\nBy the time action is taken, the harm is undeniable and already severe.\n\nSafeguarding systems don't fail because they don't know what abuse looks like.\n\nThey fail because they hesitate to confront it when doing so is uncomfortable.\n\n---\n\n## When Institutions Decide 'This Is Manageable'\n\nOne of the most dangerous moments in safeguarding is when harm becomes manageable.\n\nNot resolved.\nNot stopped.\nManaged.\n\n\"Let's monitor.\"\n\n\"Let's review.\"\n\n\"Let's keep this under observation.\"\n\n\"Let's wait for more evidence.\"\n\nThese phrases appear everywhere, across sectors, across decades.\n\nThey sound reasonable.\nThey sound cautious.\n\nBut for the child living inside the harm, they mean one thing:\n\nNothing is going to change yet.\n\n---\n\n## Why We Keep Treating Identical Failures as Separate Scandals\n\nEach time a major abuse case breaks, we act as if it's unprecedented.\n\nA shocking revelation.\nA unique collapse.\nA one-off failure.\n\nSo we investigate the setting instead of the system.\n\nSchools get new safeguarding policies.\nCare homes get new inspections.\nPolice get new guidance.\n\nBut the underlying culture fear, avoidance, reputational anxiety remains intact.\n\nAnd so the failure simply relocates.\n\n---\n\n## The Comfort of Compartmentalisation\n\nCalling these separate problems is comforting.\n\nIt allows us to believe:\n\n- grooming gangs were a policing failure\n\n- abusive teachers were a recruitment failure\n\n- care homes were a funding failure\n\nBut that compartmentalisation hides the truth:\n\n**They are all safeguarding failures rooted in the same institutional instincts.**\n\nThe instinct to delay.\nThe instinct to minimise.\nThe instinct to avoid decisive action until there is no alternative.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Pattern Keeps Repeating\n\nSafeguarding systems are built to manage risk, not to confront it early.\n\nEarly confrontation creates:\n\n- conflict\n\n- scrutiny\n\n- paperwork\n\n- institutional exposure\n\nLate confrontation creates:\n\n- reviews\n\n- apologies\n\n- \"lessons learned\"\n\n- reputational damage control\n\nThe system is far more practised at the second than the first.\n\nSo harm is allowed to continue until it becomes impossible to deny.\n\n---\n\n## What This Means for 'Reform'\n\nEvery time the government announces a new safeguarding body or oversight mechanism, the same promise is made:\n\n\"This will stop it happening again.\"\n\nBut unless reform addresses the culture of delay and denial, nothing fundamentally changes.\n\nMore oversight doesn't equal earlier action.\n\nMore reporting doesn't equal protection.\n\nAnd more reviews don't equal prevention.\n\n---\n\n## The Question We Keep Avoiding\n\nThe real question isn't why abuse keeps happening in different places.\n\nIt's this:\n\n**Why do institutions keep responding to early harm as a reputational risk instead of a child protection emergency?**\n\nUntil that question is answered honestly, grooming gangs, abusive teachers, and care home scandals will continue to surface like separate crises.\n\nThey're not.\n\nThey're symptoms of the same disease.\n\n---\n\n**Sophie Lewis | NUJ-Accredited Investigative Journalist**\n**The Grooming Files**\n\n*Next in this series: \"Britain Keeps Creating New Safeguarding Bodies — And Missing the Same

That’s how they stay unnoticed.\n\n**The Protector** – The ‘big brother’ type, always looking out for you. He makes you feel safe—until one day, *he’s* the one you need to be protected from.\n\n**The Cool Guy** – The one with the car, the money, the confidence. He makes young girls feel important, special, mature. *He makes it look like you chose him.*\n\n**The Misunderstood One** – The quiet one, the ‘nice guy’, the one who plays the victim. He tells you *no one understands him except you*. He pulls you in with **pity, not power.**\n\n**The Ghost** – The secretive one. No one knows much about him. He doesn’t draw attention, doesn’t seem like a threat. But behind closed doors? **He’s worse than all of them.**\n\nSome of them are **loud and charming**.

He’d never do that.”*\n\n**They surround themselves with easy targets.**\n\n- They **seek out vulnerability**—girls who are young, unsure of themselves, looking for attention.\n\n- They make you **feel special, feel chosen—until they take what they really wanted.**\n\nBy the time anyone realises what they are?\n\n**They’ve already moved on to their next victim.**\n\n---\n\n## **Real Moments – The Signs We Ignored**\n\nLooking back, **there were so many signs.**\n\n**The shopkeeper** who was *too friendly, always lingering, always **complimenting** young girls.*\n\n**The teacher** who *only ever seemed interested in talking to the girls, never the boys.*\n\n**The bus driver** who *kept finding excuses to talk, to ‘accidentally’ brush too close, to joke in ways that didn’t feel right.*\n\n**But we didn’t know.**\n\nWe thought it was **normal.**\n\nWe brushed it off because **no one else seemed to see it.**\n\nBut **they knew.**\n\nThey knew **exactly what they were doing.**\n\n---\n\n## **Most of Them Are Still Out There.**\n\nThe worst part? **Most of them never got caught.**\n\nThey’re still **out there, living their lives, doing the same thing to new victims.**\n\n**Why?

we least expect — and how appearances can deceive us all.*\n\n---\n\n## The Dangerous Comfort of Assumptions\n\nThere’s a quiet lie that floats beneath society’s understanding of child abuse:\n“If a family looks nice… they probably are.”\nIf the house is clean.\nIf the parents are professional.\nIf the children are well-dressed.\nThen we assume — *they’re safe.*\n\nBut that’s not how abuse works.\n**Abuse doesn’t care about postcode, income bracket, or family reputation.**\nIt thrives in silence, not in chaos.\n\nAnd sometimes, the most “put-together” families are the ones hiding the darkest secrets.\n\n---\n\n## Respectability Shields the Abuser\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000ab74620a8a0017084d222c7c2845703068335575416.png?w=1024)\n\nWhen a child from a so-called “good home” discloses abuse, the reaction is often disbelief.\n\n“Not them.”\n“They’re such a lovely family.”\n“He’s a doctor.”\n“She’s a church volunteer.”\n“They’ve never raised their voice.”\n\nThat disbelief becomes **a second betrayal** — especially when:\n\n- The abuser is seen as upstanding\n\n- The family is known and respected in the community\n\n- The disclosure threatens the family’s image or reputation\n\nIn these cases, it’s often easier for society — and even extended family — to **protect the illusion** than to protect the child.\n\n---\n\n## Clean Doesn’t Mean Safe\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/img_20250517_2210543951929814252118750.png?w=1024)\n\nAbuse doesn’t always happen in obvious dysfunction.\nIt can and does happen in:\n\n- Middle-class homes\n\n- Private school households\n\n- Religious families\n\n- Military homes\n\n- Politically engaged or “activist” circles\n\n- Upper-class families with reputations to protect\n\nThese environments are often less suspected, less investigated, and less believed.\n\nBut the reality is this:\n**Children in “good homes” are not shielded by appearances.**\nSometimes, they’re more trapped by them.\n\nBecause when everything looks perfect from the outside, there’s nowhere to run on the inside.\n\n---\n\n## Why These Families Are Rarely Scrutinised\n\nThere are many reasons why abuse in “respectable” homes gets overlooked:\n\n- **Cognitive bias:** People don’t want to believe someone like *that* would do something like *this*\n\n- **Professional status:** Doctors, lawyers, teachers seen as above suspicion\n\n- **Religious or cultural taboos:** Where reputation and image are paramount\n\n- **Power and influence:** The ability to silence, discredit, or buy privacy\n\n- **Social performance:** Abusers who know how to charm, present well, and avoid attention\n\nAnd so, disclosures are dismissed.\nCases are quietly closed.\nOr the child is made to feel like they imagined it, all because the outside world can’t accept that bad things happen behind tidy doors.\n\n---\n\n## The Illusion of Control\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000079b4620a971cc2551d89a7d45066624370176926986.png?w=1024)\n\nPeople often associate child abuse with *lack of control*, poverty, addiction, instability.\nBut many abusive households are the opposite:\n**Hyper-controlled, image-obsessed, emotionally rigid.**\n\nThese homes may be:\n\n- Strict, authoritarian, or emotionally cold\n\n- Focused on perfection, obedience, or religion\n\n- Dismissive of emotional expression\n\n- Protective of “what people will think” above all else\n\nChildren in these environments may never be hit, shouted at, or visibly neglected and yet, they live under fear.\nAnd when sexual abuse happens within that kind of silence?\nThere is no safe adult to run to.\nJust the weight of shame, guilt, and silence.\n\n---\n\n## It’s Harder to Speak When No One Believes You\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000000394620a919478c9ea95bce7282298533340338895807202.jpg?w=1024)\n\nMany survivors from high-functioning or respected families say the same thing:\n\n**“No one believed me because of who my family was.”**\n\nThey weren’t taken seriously at school.\nThey were blamed for causing trouble.\nThey were told to stay quiet to “protect the family.”\nOr they silenced themselves because they knew *people wouldn’t believe this about someone like them.*\n\nThat silence often lasts decades.\nAnd by the time it breaks, the damage is long done.\n\n---\n\n## So What Does Safety Really Look Like?\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000a87c620a85c50cf7dce69beb423552327872710552.png?w=1024)\n\nIf safety isn’t about cleanliness, wealth, or religion. What *is* it about?\n\nSafety means:\n\n- **Emotional presence**, not just physical care\n\n- **Listening without disbelief**, especially when it’s uncomfortable\n\n- **Teaching children to trust their instincts**, even when the adult seems “nice”\n\n- **Being willing to face hard truths**, even when it’s someone we know\n\n- **Creating a culture where disclosure is safe**.. Not punished or denied\n\nBecause real protection doesn’t come from outward appearances.\nIt comes from awareness, openness, and action.\n\n---\n\n## Some of the most hidden abuse happens behind the most polished front doors.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000006e44620a866dcae1cf946bf89214302741413703279.png?w=1024)\n\nBecause it’s easier to pretend everything’s fine than to ask: *What’s really going on here?*\n\nIf we want to protect children, we have to stop confusing respectability with safety.\nBecause monsters don’t always look like monsters.\nSometimes they look like pillars of the community.\n\nAnd the longer we stay fooled by the façade, the longer abuse stays hidden behind it.\n\n---\n\n**This is Part 6 of the ‘What We’re

Drinking, hanging out, being reckless teenagers. It all felt normal at the time. But now, knowing what I know, I see things for what they really were.\n\nI knew **Benjamin Guiver** years ago. Back then, I was **16, and he was 19**. He had moved to **Cwmaman, Aberdare** from England, apparently because of “trouble back home.” At the time, no one really questioned what that meant. We were young; we had our own lives to live. But looking back, I can’t help but wonder—**what exactly was he running from?**\n\nBen was **always strange**. He was moody, bitter, and often **angry at the world**. He never seemed happy, but in our group, we didn’t analyse things too much. We drank together, spent time together, and carried on as normal.\n\nBut Ben wasn’t just another lost teenager. **He was a predator.**\n\n---\n\n## **The Red Flags Were Always There**\n\nAt **19 years old**, he was in a **relationship with a 13-year-old girl** from our group. At the time, we didn’t see it for what it was. It was just “one of those things.” But now?

I know I did.\n\nBut he didn’t stop.\nHe just carried on like my words didn’t matter.\nLike I didn’t matter.\n\nI think my friend ran out.\nI think she knew better than me.\nI stayed — because by then, somewhere deep down, I thought maybe this was what being liked felt like.\nI thought maybe this was normal.\nBecause when wrong things happen to you enough times, you start confusing them with love.\n\nAfterwards, I didn’t know if I was supposed to feel ashamed or special.\nI just knew I felt sick.\nThe kind of sick that doesn't come from too much chocolate.\n\nI ran home after.\nI didn’t even think — my legs just moved, carrying the sick feeling in my stomach all the way to my front door.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_0000000054dc6246bf41e5464586538c4843333760693499466.png?w=683)\n\nI told them.\nI told my dad.\nI told her.\nI told them everything in the only way a kid knows how — messy, scared, desperate to be believed.\n\nThey called the police.\nFor a moment, I thought maybe it would be okay.\nMaybe someone would finally listen.\nMaybe someone would protect me.\n\nBut they didn’t.\n\nThey said I was attention-seeking.\nThey said it was because I’d only just been adopted, that I was \"acting out.\"\n\nThey didn't see a child who was hurting.\nThey saw a problem to dismiss.\nAnd just like that, I learned that even when you scream the truth, some people will choose not to hear it.\n\nYears went by.\n\nYears where I carried it alone.\nWhere I swallowed it down every time someone looked at me like I was trouble.\nYears of wondering if maybe I had imagined it.\nMaybe it hadn’t been as bad as I remembered.\nMaybe I was the problem, just like they said.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000db8c6246b1a604ec43830c2c4057001092489354320.png?w=683)\n\nAnd then one day — years later — the messages started coming in.\nFrom my sister.\nFrom people I hadn't heard from in forever.\nEven from him.\n\n“He’s been convicted.”\n\nJust like that.\nThree words that cracked open everything.\n\nI didn’t cry.\nI didn’t shout.\nI laughed.\nA bitter, broken laugh that tasted like blood.\n\nBecause why did it take them so long to believe me?\nWhy did it have to come to this?\nWhy did they think a little girl would make something like that up?\n\nYou don't lie about things that stain you.\n\nYou don't invent the kind of shame that follows you into adulthood, into your bed, into your bones.\n\nThey told me sorry.\nThey told me they should have listened.\nBut by then, the sorrys came too late.\n\nDespite everything,\nI still believe in good.\n\nI still believe in something bigger than men who twist trust into weapons.\nBigger than smiling faces that hide knives behind their backs.\nBigger than the people who heard my voice and chose to silence it.\n\nHe was supposed to be safe.\nHe wasn’t.\nBut that doesn't mean goodness never existed.\nIt just means sometimes, it hides in the ones nobody thought to listen to.\n\nThis is my voice now.\nIt’s not quiet anymore.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_0000000041b06246bd0d7094509a21d22818177344702693438.png?w=683)","src/content/articles/i-still-believe-in-good-part-one-the-priest-betrayed-by-trust.md","f4a6dc195cdd4d23",{"html":2006,"metadata":2007},"\u003Cp>By Sophie Lewis - The Grooming Files | The Indie Leaks | @realtalkrealtea\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Disclaimer:\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cem>This story has been shared with full consent.

The request was denied. In response, the pair allegedly placed a handwritten note in their window referencing the officer.\n\nThat night, it’s claimed the officer returned and spent hours deliberately banging on their cell door, keeping them awake — and reportedly shouted at them to:\n\n> \n> **“Go swallow some blades.”**\n> \n> \n> \n\nThe following day, one of the individuals, known to be under ACT monitoring for self-harm risk. Allegedly entered the dinner queue with a blade and began cutting himself in front of others.\n\nSeveral staff members were reportedly present. One officer allegedly remained seated and unresponsive.

Dial-up tones. MSN Messenger. Webcams balanced on bulky monitors. No rules. No warnings. No one watching.\n\nAnd the predators? They found us before our parents even knew what a USB was.\n\nIt started in the chatrooms. Kids Chat. MSN. Yahoo. \n\nWe’d log in at 9, say we were 14, and within minutes we were being asked:\n\n*\"*What you* wearing?\"*\n*\"You’re cute.\"*\n*\"Show me.\"*\n\nThey showed themselves too. Full-grown men.. not 18, not 21, men in their 30s, 40s, 60s. They told us we were special. Mature. Beautiful. And we believed them, because nobody told us not to.\n\n---\n\n## **It Became Normal**\n\nIt didn’t feel like grooming. It felt like attention. Excitement. Thrill. Fear. Shame. All tangled together in a way that still knots up in my chest to this day.\n\nWe started meeting them. Men with cars. Men with drinks. We lied about our ages, because that’s what girls did. We said we were 16 when we were 13.\n\nBut the truth? We looked 10. And they knew it.\n\nWe thought we loved it. That’s what they made us believe. That wasn’t informed consent, that was childhood confusion weaponised.\n\nIt became so normal it was daily. The damage was done before we even knew we were bleeding.\n\n---\n\n## **Ben Could’ve Killed Me**\n\nHis name was “Ben.”\n\nHe was much older, Pakistani or Indian, I don’t know. We’d seen him once, walking home. He offered a lift. There were a few of us, so we got in. Young. Naive. Stupid. But kids.\n\nThe next time, I went alone.\n\nHe picked me up. Drove me to some secluded spot.. dark, empty, silent. My gut screamed. Everything in me said run. But I was trapped in his car.\n\nHe leaned in. Tried to kiss me. Grabbed at me. Pressured me. His hands. His breath. His force.\n\nI froze. So I lied.\n\nPretended my sister was calling. Faked a conversation. Loudly said where I was, just in case. He hesitated. Maybe it scared him. Maybe it didn’t. But he drove me home.\n\nThe moment we hit my estate, I opened that door before the car even stopped and ran like hell.\n\nBecause I truly believed, if I hadn’t he’d have raped me. Or worse.\n\n---\n\n## **20 Men. Two Girls. No Way Out.**\n\nJ said she knew them.\n*\"They’re alright,\"* she said. *\"It’s fine.\"*\n\nThey were Nigerian. They picked us up, two teenage girls.. and took us to a house.\n\nWhen we walked in?\nMore than 20 men. All older. All staring.\n\nSomething was wrong. The air was heavy. We were offered drinks. I told J not to take it. She did anyway.\n\nThen we were on the move again, to another house, just the two original men now. We followed, confused. Upstairs. Into a bedroom.\n\nIt became clear, fast.\n\nThis wasn’t a hangout. This was a setup.\n\nI grabbed J’s arm and said, *\"We’re going.\"*\n\nWe ran. Pushed past the men. Jumped over them on the stairs. Flew out the door and didn’t stop.\n\nWe called two older guys we knew, the only people we could think of.\n\nThey picked us up. Got us out of there.\n\nIt was over. But it never really was.\n\nBecause we were just kids. And it had become normal to be in danger.\n\n---\n\n## **They Said We Were Naughty Girls**\n\nI once tried to speak out. I’d had enough. I cracked. I told someone. And they didn’t believe me. Worse, they blamed me.\n\nI was unstable. Dramatic.\n\n*\"You loved the attention.\"*\n*\"It’s your fault.\"*\n*\"You were asking for it.\"*\n\nEven now, when I talk to girls I grew up with, they ask:\n*\"Was it really grooming?\"*\n*\"We were naughty, weren’t we?\"*\n*\"Did that really happen to us?\"*\n\nYes. Yes, it did.\n\nThat is the sound of an entire generation gaslit by silence.\n\nWe were groomed online and offline, while every adult in the system looked away.\n\n---\n\n## **What the System Never Saw — Because It Wasn’t Looking**\n\nThere were no safeguarding policies for what we lived through. No assemblies warning us about “online predators.” No teachers trained in grooming recognition. No systems prepared for what the internet was unleashing.\n\nWe were the first generation to be groomed through a screen. And the institutions that were meant to protect us? They were still warning us about strangers with sweets in vans.\n\nWhile we were being exploited by men in our inboxes, schools were still showing us cartoon leaflets about “saying no to drugs.” Police didn’t know what screenshots were. Social workers weren’t trained in digital abuse. And the law? It barely existed.\n\nThe internet was a playground, but predators were the only ones who read the rules.\n\n---\n\n## **The Internet Grew — But Protection Didn’t**\n\nBy the time adults caught up, the damage was done. We weren’t seen as victims, we were labelled problems.\n\nDisruptive. Promiscuous. Attention-seeking.\n\nOur trauma was punished. Not supported. Not believed. Not understood.\n\nThey didn’t ask why we were spiralling. They gave us detentions, suspensions, isolation rooms. They moved us from school to school. They called our parents in. But they never called out the men messaging us at midnight.\n\n---\n\n## **We Were Never Asked the Right Questions**\n\nNobody said:\n*\"Are you okay?\"*\n*\"Do you feel safe online?\"*\n*\"Has anyone ever made you uncomfortable in a chatroom?\"*\n\nWe were never taught that being manipulated by a 35-year-old man wasn’t our fault. Instead, we were told to be careful, like we were the problem.\n\nAnd we internalised that.\n\nFor years, we thought we were “naughty.” We laughed it off. We carried the shame. We blamed ourselves and each other.\n\nBut we weren’t being difficult. We were being groomed. And nobody. Ever. Asked.\n\n---\n\n## **The Legacy We Still Carry**\n\nIt didn’t end when the messages stopped. Or when the house door shut. Or when the man drove away.\n\nIt stayed with us.\n\nIn our nervous systems. In our relationships. In our sense of safety. In the way we second-guess ourselves, even now.\n\nWe survived the grooming. But nobody prepared us for the aftermath.\n\n---\n\n## **We Grew Up — But the Damage Grew With Us**\n\nThe world taught us that what happened to us wasn’t that serious. So we learned to swallow it.\n\nWe carried trauma into our teens. Into sex. Into adulthood. Into breakdowns and addiction. Into trust issues and triggered silences. Into *“why can’t I just get over it?”*\n\nAnd still, it’s rare anyone names it for what it was.\n\nBecause we didn’t get groomed today, with safeguarding policies and public outrage. We got groomed back then, in the wild west of the internet, when people thought it was just “girls being flirty.”\n\nNo one saw us as victims. So we didn’t know we were.\n\n---\n\n## **Even Now, We Doubt Ourselves**\n\nThat’s the legacy. Not just trauma, but doubt.\n\nWe still hear the voices in our heads:\n*\"Was it really that bad?\"*\n*\"We went along with it, didn’t we?\"*\n*\"We lied about our age, though...\"*\n\nWe repeat the lies we were fed. We laugh when we talk about it, because we don’t know what else to do. We swap horror stories like they’re throwaway memories.\n\nBut deep down? We know we weren’t wild. We were unprotected.\n\nAnd that’s what hurts the most, that we’ve had to live this long wondering if we did this to ourselves.\n\nWe didn’t.\n\n---\n\n## **This Never Stopped — It Just Got Easier**\n\nPredators didn’t disappear when the dial-up tone died. They evolved, just like the tech did.\n\nNow they don’t need to lurk in MSN chatrooms. They’re on Snapchat. TikTok. Discord. Instagram. Fake names. Disappearing messages. Private servers.\n\nThey don’t have to ask for your number. They can reach a 12-year-old from a stranger’s story share or a mutual follow.\n\nThey don’t have to drive around looking for vulnerable girls. They scroll for them. They search hashtags like “lonely.” They read comments under selfies.\n\nAnd the difference now? It’s faster. It’s smarter. It’s constant.\n\nAnd still, the system hasn’t caught up.\n\n---\n\n## **They Still Count on Silence**\n\nGrooming follows the same steps it always did:\n\nSpot the vulnerability\n\nBuild trust\n\nCreate shame\n\nExploit silence\n\nCount on institutions to do nothing\n\nBecause that’s what still happens today.\n\nA child discloses abuse? They’re asked what they were wearing. How many people they’d slept with. Whether they were “mature for their age.”\n\nThe same grooming culture we lived through, is still being handled with the same doubt, denial, and delay.\n\n---\n\n## **The System Learns Nothing**\n\nWe’ve had inquiries. We’ve had safeguarding scandals. We’ve had high-profile convictions and public horror.\n\nAnd yet:\n\nPolice still dismiss “difficult” victims\n\nSchools still prioritise reputation over protection\n\nThe CPS still drops cases citing “credibility”\n\nChildren are still moved while abusers stay put\n\nWe’re still here. Screaming the same things we tried to say 20 years ago, and still being told we’re “complicating things.”\n\n---\n\n## **We’re Done Being Quiet — And We’re Not Asking Anymore**\n\nWe’re not confused anymore. We’re not wondering if it “counts.” We’re not searching for the right words to make it palatable.\n\nWe know what it was. It was grooming. Abuse. Neglect. Silence. And it wasn’t our fault.\n\nYou don’t get to blame children for being vulnerable. You don’t get to excuse grown men who target trauma. And you definitely don’t get to call it a “failure” when the system was built to look the other way.\n\n---\n\n## **This Is Our Reckoning**\n\nWe’re not asking for awareness. We’re done trying to make this easy to hear. We’re not tiptoeing around reputation or waiting for permission.\n\nWe are naming names. We are connecting patterns. We are exposing the blueprint.\n\nThis is not a call for more safeguarding leaflets or carefully worded apologies.\nThis is a demand:\n**Acknowledge us. Protect the next generation. And stop pretending this wasn’t by design.**\n\n---\n\n## **You Can’t Erase Us**\n\nWe were there. We saw everything. We’re still here. And we’re louder than ever.\n\nYou didn’t break us. You didn’t erase us. You made us dangerous, because now we understand exactly what you did.\n\nAnd we’re not going away.\n\n---\n\n**Author’s Note:**\n\nIf this feels familiar, you’re not alone. Your story matters. Even if you’ve never spoken it out loud. Especially if no one ever believed you.\n\n**It was real. It happened. And it wasn’t your fault.** ❤️","src/content/articles/n-a-draft.md","ecfb9aad6fc952e5",{"html":2121,"metadata":2122},"\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000f2d862468f591cf18ae4aaf3667293544475812374.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>We were the first kids online.

But for many survivors of grooming, the exit is only the beginning. The real captivity continues inside.. a quiet, relentless echo of the predator’s voice, long after he’s gone.\n\nThis is not metaphor. It is programming.\n\n---\n\n## **The Script They Never Chose**\n\nOne of the most reported aftershocks of grooming isn’t physical, it’s psychological. Survivors often describe hearing internalised messages like:\n\n- \"No one will believe you.\"\n\n- \"You liked it.\"\n\n- \"You're dirty.\"\n\n- \"You’ll never escape me.\"\n\nThese aren't passing thoughts. They’re embedded scripts. Planted over time through coercion, manipulation, silence, and shame, until they sound like the survivor’s own voice.\n\nThis is how grooming works: not just through control, but through *conditioning*. The predator builds a narrative and installs it inside the victim. Even after the physical abuse stops, the script continues.\n\n---\n\n## **Trauma That Talks Back**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_000000006ecc61f4aead1d507ec57c1074954531650378991.png?w=683)\n\nStandard therapy often tackles surface memories, but survivors of grooming face something more insidious: an internal commentator that shames, doubts, and derails them. Even in moments of healing, survivors report a mental presence questioning their worth, rewriting their truth, or minimising what happened.\n\nIt isn’t just memory, it’s mental colonisation.\n\nSome survivors never realise this voice isn’t theirs. Others spend years trying to “think positively” or “move on,” not knowing they are still operating under the predator’s rules.\n\n---\n\n## **Echoes in the Room**\n\nThe predator’s voice doesn’t just live in the mind. It finds new hosts.\n\nPartners. Friends. Therapists. Authorities. All capable of unknowingly echoing that same tone:\n\n- \"Are you sure it was abuse?\"\n\n- \"You need to let it go.\"\n\n- \"But you were old enough to know better.\"\n\nSurvivors are retraumatised not just by what’s said but by how familiar it sounds. As if the predator is still speaking *through* the people around them.\n\nThis is how abuse becomes systemic. Not just through action, but through repetition.\n\n---\n\n## **Living With the Voice**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_00000000095c6246bf1ee53381c539b6946665610591918634.png?w=683)\n\nMany survivors describe an internal war:\n\n- Wanting to speak, but hearing, \"Don’t.\"\n\n- Wanting to heal, but hearing, \"You deserved it.\"\n\n- Wanting to love, but hearing, \"You’re too broken.\"\n\nThese are not flaws in the survivor. These are the residue of grooming, a haunting script designed to silence, to shame, and to stop the reclamation of power.\n\nBut the script *can* be broken.\n\n---\n\n## **Rewriting the Narrative**\n\nSurvivors who recognise the voice begin a process of mental deprogramming a long, conscious effort to dismantle what was installed. This isn’t easy work. But it is possible. Some of the methods survivors use include:\n\n- **Naming the voice**: separating predator language from personal truth.\n\n- **Writing and destroying**: confronting the script and physically tearing it apart.\n\n- **Mirror rituals**: speaking out loud what the predator never let them say.\n\n- **Art and performance**: reclaiming the narrative through creativity.\n\n- **Community witnessing**: being seen, heard, and believed by others who know the echo.\n\nEvery act of truth-telling is a line overwritten. Every act of self-belief is a line erased.\n\n---\n\n## **The Predator Is Not the Final Voice**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_0000000020c861f4b2c66f19bdb69ddb6286536831332358808.png?w=1024)\n\nThe voice they left behind is not a life sentence. It’s a lie, one that can be exorcised.\n\nSurvivors are not weak for hearing it. They are warriors for naming it.

They’re harmed by someone they know.**\nIn fact, according to NSPCC and other safeguarding bodies, around **85–90% of child sexual abuse is committed by someone the child knows and trusts.**\n\n- A biological parent.\n\n- A stepfather.\n\n- An older sibling.\n\n- A teacher.\n\n- A neighbour.\n\n- A friend’s dad.\n\n- A family friend everyone calls “uncle.”\n\nThese are not fringe figures. They’re central. And often, they’re loved.\n\nThis is what makes the abuse more damaging. And far harder to speak about.\n\n---\n\n## The “Monster Myth” Lets Them Blend In\n\nWhen we only teach children to fear strangers, we give abusers a gift:\n\n**Camouflage.**\n\nIf a child sees their abuser as kind, funny, respected, even admired. It becomes nearly impossible for them to reconcile that with “something bad happening.”\nEspecially if the abuse is gradual, disguised as affection, or attached to manipulation like:\n\n- “This is our secret.”\n\n- “I do this because I love you.”\n\n- “If you tell anyone, you’ll ruin everything.”\n\nSociety’s obsession with “monsters” makes us blind to these subtler but far more common realities.\n\n---\n\n## Grooming Adults Before Children\n\nOne of the least understood truths about child sexual abuse is this:\n\n**Abusers don’t just groom children. They groom adults too.**\n\nThey earn trust. Play the part. Offer help. Work their way into people’s good books.\nThis is especially common in:\n\n- Schools\n\n- Sports clubs\n\n- Religious settings\n\n- Foster and care homes\n\n- Extended family networks\n\nWhen the time comes for a child to speak up, the adults around them may already be disarmed.\n“They’d never do that.”\n“They’re such a lovely person.”\n“They’ve always been great with kids.”\n\nAnd just like that, the door closes. Not on the abuser, but on the child.\n\n---\n\n## Not All Abusers Look or Act the Same\n\nForget the stereotypes. Abusers don’t all fit one look, personality type, or background.\n\nSome are outgoing. Some are quiet.\nSome are poor. Some are powerful.\nSome have criminal records. Many do not.\nSome are angry and forceful. Others are calculated and patient.\n\nThe common thread isn’t *who they are*, it’s *what they do:*\nThey exploit vulnerability. They cross boundaries. They manipulate silence.\nAnd often, they rely on the fact that nobody suspects them.\n\n---\n\n## Why Survivors Are So Often Disbelieved\n\nWhen a child discloses abuse by someone close, someone loved, respected, or admired. They’re not just risking disbelief.\nThey’re risking rupture.\n\nThey might be breaking up a family. Exposing a secret. Shattering an illusion.\n\nThat’s a terrifying weight to place on the shoulders of a child.\nAnd many decide, consciously or not to carry the pain quietly instead.\n\nOthers *do* speak. But because the abuser “doesn’t seem like the type,” they’re met with doubt, silence, or worse: blame.\n\n---\n\n## Denial Is a Breeding Ground\n\nThe truth is hard to sit with. \n\nBut we have to:\n\n**Abuse doesn’t happen because we didn’t spot the monster. It happens because we refused to look where it was most likely to be.**\n\nEvery time we picture abuse as a freak occurrence carried out by a “sick individual,” we make it harder for survivors to be believed.\n\nAnd we make it easier for the next predator to blend in.\n\n---\n\n## What Needs to Change\n\nIf we want to protect children, *really* protect them, we must rewire the narrative. That starts with:\n\n- **Educating children** that abuse can come from people they know\n\n- **Teaching adults** the signs of grooming, even when the person is likeable\n\n- **Believing survivors** when they speak up, even if the accused doesn’t “seem the type”\n\n- **Replacing shock with vigilance** — understanding that abuse isn’t rare, but hidden\n\nThis doesn’t mean turning everyone into a suspect. It means widening our lens.\nKnowing that safety comes from awareness. Not denial.\n\n---\n\n## There is no single face of a predator.\n\nThere is no one type of abuser.\n\nBut there is a pattern:\n\n**Silence. Shame. And the myth that it couldn’t happen here.**\n\nIf we keep chasing monsters, we’ll miss the ones already sitting at the dinner table.\n\nIt’s time to see clearly. And protect bravely.\n\n---\n\n**This is Part 2 of the ‘What We’re Still Not Talking About’ series.**\nRead the flagship article here:[What We're Still Not Talking About ](http://thegroomingfiles.com/2025/05/10/what-were-still-not-talking-about/)","src/content/articles/not-just-monsters-why-most-abusers-arent-who-you-think.md","6f7b79574ece1f39",{"html":2306,"metadata":2307},"\u003Cp>© By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"a-survivor-led-educational-breakdown-of-the-biggest-myth-fuelling-child-sexual-abuse-silence\">\u003Cem>A survivor-led educational breakdown of the biggest myth fuelling child sexual abuse silence.\u003C/em>\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000aba46243ba5bd2d23ea909932152549747025976000.png?w=683\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"we-like-to-think-wed-see-it\">We Like to Think We’d See It\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Ask the average person what a child abuser looks like, and you’ll likely get a description straight out of a crime drama:\nA man.

Why did you reach out to me — what made you pick me?**\n**Eddie:** I watched one of the videos on your site, picked you because you want to expose what’s going on.\n\n**Q2. What are the exact allegations you’re facing with CPS right now?**\n**Eddie:** Allegations are receiving inappropriate images of children, and sending inappropriate images of children. Upskirting.\n\n**Q3. Have you ever offended against a child — yes or no?**\n**Eddie:** 3 no.\n\n**Q4. Do you believe you’re a danger to children right now?**\n**Eddie:** 4 no.\n\n**Q5. Would you offend again if nobody stopped you?**\n**Eddie:** 5 no.\n\n**Q6. You said you’ve watched exposure videos — what do they do for you?**\n**Eddie:** Do nothing for me really, just watched for curiosity reasons.\n\n**Q7. What does “being exposed” mean to you personally?**\n**Eddie:** These sites and the people running these sites need to be exposed, it’s just getting out of control.\n\n---\n\n**Q8. Is exposure a punishment for you, or is it something you secretly want?**\n**Eddie:** No it’s not punishment for me. What punishment? For these sites online and the people running them — they need punishment.\n\n**Q9. What happens in your head before you reach out for “exposure”?**\n**Eddie:** My head is telling me to expose the people who need exposing.\n\n**Q10. After you confess or get exposed, do you feel relief… or arousal?**\n**Eddie:** If I get exposed, allegations at the moment, but will be relieved when it’s over.\n\n**Q11. How long does that feeling last before the urges come back?**\n**Eddie:** Feeling can come back sometimes when I see schoolgirls.\n\n**Q12. What’s the darkest thought you’ve ever had that you’ve never told anyone?**\n**Eddie:** Having sex with a schoolgirl in uniform and other things.\n\n**Q13. Do you think the system (police, CPS, social services) can stop people like you?**\n**Eddie:** Yes course we can be stopped, as you can see am under investigation.\n\n**Q14. What kind of help or intervention would actually stop you?**\n**Eddie:** Nothing.\n\n**Q15. What do you want people to know about you when this is published?**\n**Eddie:** That I have helped in exposing people.\n\n---\n\n**Q16. You say you’re not a danger — so why do you admit urges come back when you see schoolgirls?**\n**Eddie:** I am not attracted to children, there just thoughts I get. I would never act on it.\n\n**Q17. You say you’re “helping expose people” — who exactly do you mean?**\n**Eddie:** These people who prey on children online, it’s disgusting.\n\n**Q18. If you’ve “done nothing,” why are there multiple allegations against you?**\n**Eddie:** Can’t answer that.\n\n**Q19. Why did you admit your darkest thought so openly? Did you want someone to finally know?**\n**Eddie:** It’s just fantasy. I can get aroused seeing 18 year old in uniform.\n\n**Q20. Do you understand that admitting these fantasies is proof you’re a danger?**\n**Eddie:** Am not a danger to anyone. I will never act on it. It’s fantasy.\n\n---\n\n**Q1. When did you first realise you were sexually attracted to children?**\n**Eddie:** 1 am not attracted to children. There just thoughts I get, I would never act on it.\n\n**Q2. Do you think about children every day, or only in certain situations?**\n**Eddie:** Certain situations, which is not often.\n\n**Q3. What is it about school uniforms that excites you?**\n**Eddie:** It’s the short skirts with no leggings or stockings, which some skirts are too short.\n\n**Q4. Do you see children as “sexual beings,” or do you know it’s wrong while still wanting it?**\n**Eddie:** Obviously it’s wrong and they’re not sexual beings. That’s why I should never act on it.\n\n**Q5. What’s the youngest age you’ve fantasised about?**\n**Eddie:** 16.\n\n---\n\n**Q6. When you contacted me, what outcome were you really hoping for?**\n**Eddie:** To expose pedofiles who are using children as sexual objects.\n\n**Q7. Do you ever get aroused while talking about being exposed?**\n**Eddie:** No. That does not arouse me.\n\n**Q8. Would you rather go to prison, or be exposed publicly?**\n**Eddie:** They should get exposed, that’s why am helping you.\n\n**Q9. Do you ever imagine being humiliated for what you’ve done? Does that turn you on?**\n**Eddie:** I have visited a dominatrix to be punished. And punished I got for having nawty feelings and wearing panties.\n\n**Q10. Why reach out to someone who exposes predators, if you truly didn’t want exposure?**\n**Eddie:** To expose the ones who need exposing.\n\n---\n\n**Q11. Do you think prison will change you? Why or why not?**\n**Eddie:** Feelings are feelings. You don’t want them but you get them, so no, you can’t change it.\n\n**Q12. If therapy was offered, would you take it seriously?**\n**Eddie:** Yes.\n\n**Q13. What’s more powerful for you — fear of the police, or fear of being exposed?**\n**Eddie:** Fear of being exposed.\n\n**Q14. Do you think sting groups help or make predators worse?**\n**Eddie:** Make predators worse.\n\n**Q15. What kind of punishment do you personally think you deserve?**\n**Eddie:** Punishment I deserve, dominatrix takes care of that.\n\n---\n\n**Q16. Can you explain why you get aroused seeing girls in uniform?**\n**Eddie:** Can’t explain it. I just get aroused seeing girls in uniform.\n\n**Q17. Do you link your “sissy” identity to the urges you have about schoolgirls?**\n**Eddie:** No, because I didn’t start dressing as a sissy before I visited the dominatrix.\n\n**Q18. When the dominatrix punished you, did you dress as a sissy at the same time?**\n**Eddie:** Yes, dressed as sissy when she is punishing me.\n\n**Q19. Does humiliation (being called out, punished, exposed) make your urges stronger?**\n**Eddie:** Only in a BDSM setting with mistress.\n\n**Q20. Do you want me to see you as a “sissy” predator — is that why you reached out?**\n**Eddie:** No.\n\n---\n\n**Q21. If you weren’t under CPS investigation right now, do you think you would still have reached out to me?**\n**Eddie:** Probably not.\n\n**Q22. Have you ever spoken to children online or in person in a sexual way?**\n**Eddie:** Never.\n\n**Q23. What’s the difference, in your mind, between thinking about children and acting on it?**\n**Eddie:** I’m not going to act on it with a child. Adult yes.\n\n---\n\n**Q (Follow-up): You told me you get aroused seeing schoolgirls in uniform.

What is it about school uniforms that excites you?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> It’s the short skirts with no leggings or stockings, which some skirts are too short.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q4. Do you see children as “sexual beings,” or do you know it’s wrong while still wanting it?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> Obviously it’s wrong and they’re not sexual beings. That’s why I should never act on it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q5. What’s the youngest age you’ve fantasised about?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> 16.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q6. When you contacted me, what outcome were you really hoping for?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> To expose pedofiles who are using children as sexual objects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q7.

Do you ever imagine being humiliated for what you’ve done? Does that turn you on?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> I have visited a dominatrix to be punished. And punished I got for having nawty feelings and wearing panties.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q10. Why reach out to someone who exposes predators, if you truly didn’t want exposure?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> To expose the ones who need exposing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q11. Do you think prison will change you? Why or why not?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> Feelings are feelings. You don’t want them but you get them, so no, you can’t change it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q12. If therapy was offered, would you take it seriously?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q13. What’s more powerful for you — fear of the police, or fear of being exposed?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> Fear of being exposed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q14. Do you think sting groups help or make predators worse?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> Make predators worse.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q15. What kind of punishment do you personally think you deserve?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> Punishment I deserve, dominatrix takes care of that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q16. Can you explain why you get aroused seeing girls in uniform?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> Can’t explain it. I just get aroused seeing girls in uniform.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q17. Do you link your “sissy” identity to the urges you have about schoolgirls?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> No, because I didn’t start dressing as a sissy before I visited the dominatrix.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q18. When the dominatrix punished you, did you dress as a sissy at the same time?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> Yes, dressed as sissy when she is punishing me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q19. Does humiliation (being called out, punished, exposed) make your urges stronger?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> Only in a BDSM setting with mistress.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q20. Do you want me to see you as a “sissy” predator — is that why you reached out?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> No.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q21.

Have you ever spoken to children online or in person in a sexual way?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> Never.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q23. What’s the difference, in your mind, between thinking about children and acting on it?\u003C/strong>\n\u003Cstrong>Eddie:\u003C/strong> I’m not going to act on it with a child.

I’ve been accused of harbouring offenders in my home, of “protecting” men I’ve publicly exposed, and of blurring the very lines I’ve worked so hard to illuminate.\n\nNone of it is true.\nBut the noise has become so loud that silence no longer feels like strength, it feels like surrender.\nSo here it is, the full picture. \n\nMy words. My voice. My work, explained properly, professionally, and without shame.\n\n---\n\n## Who I Am — And Why I Did This Work\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dovtuc1045320048055118929.jpg?w=1024)\n\nMy name is Sophie Lewis. I’m a survivor. I’m a writer, an investigative journalist, and the founder of *The Grooming Files*. I hold a valid NUJ press card and specialise in exposing systemic failures in safeguarding and offender management.\n\nI’m also disabled. I live with lifelong physical and neurological conditions, including Aphantasia, a brain difference that means I cannot picture images in my mind. But what I *can* do is feel people. Deeply. I process energy, behaviour, contradiction. I don’t imagine, I *sense*.\n\nAnd it’s through that lens that I ended up in one of the darkest, most misunderstood corners of modern journalism.. \n**Face-to-face with predators who wanted to confess.**\n\nThis wasn’t something I sought out. I didn’t plan it.\nBut when the first man approached me, a predator, mid-spiral, aware he was dangerous and desperate to be exposed. I didn’t look away. I listened.\n\nI said yes to the interview.\nAnd that one moment became a turning point.\n\n---\n\n## The Interviews: What Actually Happened\n\nLet me be absolutely clear: I have never invited a predator into my home. I’ve never hosted them, comforted them, or glorified them.\nWhat I did was investigate them, thoroughly, professionally, and under full public scrutiny.\n\nThey came to me voluntarily.\nI did not go looking.\n\nThey wanted exposure.\nI gave them something far more confronting: accountability.\n\nThese interviews were not casual conversations. They were structured, psychologically loaded interrogations that aimed to unpack motivation, risk, and system failure. Every question I asked came from a place of lived experience, survivor responsibility, and long-standing frustration at the institutions that continue to fail the public.\n\nI never promised them protection. I never offered friendship. What I offered was the chance to explain themselves, with the full knowledge that I would publish it.\n\nAnd I did. With clarity. With transcripts. With survivor-framed narrative.\n\nBecause people deserve to know *how* this happens, not just *that* it does.\n\n---\n\n## What I Found — And Why It Matters\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_00000000cc4461f4a1f787b82466625d1220446376555322904.png?w=1024)\n\nOver time, a disturbing pattern began to emerge.\n\nMultiple men came forward. All unconnected. All confessing, spiralling, struggling with shame, and seeking some form of external control. They weren’t just trying to hide, they were trying to *implode* in public, hoping someone would stop them before they hurt a child.\n\nAnd no one was stopping them.\nNot the police. Not social services. Not even some of the “exposure groups,” who often chased clout instead of evidence.\n\nI named this pattern for what it was:\n\nThe **Exposure-Seeking Predator**.\n\nA newly emerging typology.\nNot well-researched. Not acknowledged in safeguarding protocols.\nBut real. Documented. And terrifying.\n\nThese men weren’t coming forward for redemption.\nThey were doing it because they didn’t trust themselves and they had nowhere else to go.\n\nIf that doesn’t highlight a catastrophic gap in public safety, I don’t know what does.\n\n---\n\n## SafeCheck — What It Was (And What It Wasn’t)\n\nIn response to these spirals, I created a pilot system called **SafeCheck**.\n\nIt was a voluntary behavioural accountability framework for high-risk individuals. A space where men who *knew* they were a risk could submit to strict, structured, non-negotiable daily tasks:\n\n- Daily self-monitoring and confessional writing\n\n- Monthly reflection tasks\n\n- Locked confession files\n\n- Zero tolerance for grooming, fantasy, or manipulation\n\nThis wasn’t kink.\nIt wasn’t glorified domination.\nIt wasn’t therapy.\nIt was a psychological brake. A structured intervention in a vacuum where nothing else existed.\n\nIt was founded *by a survivor*.\nBuilt *from lived experience*.\nAnd run with more clarity and consequence than most offender management pathways I’ve witnessed.\n\nWas it experimental? Yes.\nWas it ethically heavy? Absolutely.\nBut it was *real*. It worked. And it came from a place of responsibility, not spectacle.\n\nSafeCheck is no longer active. I closed it when the emotional toll outweighed the reach. But its existence proved one thing: *offenders will submit to structure when it’s survivor-led and shame-proof*.\n\nThat is data.\nThat is progress.\nAnd that should never have been reduced to rumours.\n\n---\n\n## The Personal Cost — And My Decision to Keep Going\n\nI’ve paid for this work in more ways than I can count.\n\nI’ve received horrendous message, Death threats. Anonymous abuse.\nI’ve had my parenting attacked, my reputation smeared, my face passed around forums with lies under it.\n\nAnd what was my crime?\n\n**Investigating predators before they offend.**\n**Saying what others won’t.**\n**Creating what didn’t exist.**\n\nIf that makes me a target, so be it.\n\nBecause I’d do it all again.\nA thousand times over.\n\nThe predators I confronted weren’t offered friendship. They were offered a choice:\nFace the mirror, or run from it.\n\nMost ran.

I picked it because the chart moved like something I’d survived.\n\nIn 2023, I started watching Palantir. Not because I’d researched it. Not because someone tipped me off. But because its chart *spoke* to me.\n\nI saw it. I felt it. I knew its movements. Resistance zones, breakout patterns, consolidation stretches. I didn’t know what Palantir was. But I knew the pattern was real.\n\nAnd now I understand why.\n\nPalantir Technologies isn’t just another tech firm. It’s a government-contract-backed data surveillance giant. Their clients? The CIA, NSA, military departments, predictive policing units. Their product? Software that digests mass data and forecasts threats.\n\nIt builds **pre-emptive control infrastructure**. For war. For policing. For profit.\n\nThe moment I learned what Palantir was, everything clicked. I hadn’t just been tracking a company. I’d been tracking a **signal**. And that signal aligned perfectly with the theory I’ve spent years building.\n\n---\n\n## The Human Chart Cycle: Proved in Real Time\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_0000000074586243bb4e091f22b982225970230512033325677.png?w=1024)\n\nMy Human Chart Cycle theory maps the behavioural patterns of markets, movements, and nervous systems. It follows a predictable, trauma-rooted flow:\n\n> \n> **Accumulation → Breakout → Resistance → Collapse → Regeneration**\n> \n> \n> \n\nAnd Palantir’s stock chart mirrors this *exactly*.\n\n- **Accumulation Phase (2022 to early 2023):** Price flatlines. Public awareness low. Tension building quietly.\n\n- **Breakout Phase (mid-2023):** Sudden rally. AI narratives go mainstream. New investor hype floods in.\n\n- **Resistance Phase (late 2023 to early 2024):** Price stalls. Volatility increases. Faith in the system starts cracking.\n\n- **Breakout Again (mid-2024 to now):** Price explodes. All-time highs hit. Why? Because governments are preparing for conflict. And Palantir is built for war.\n\nThis isn’t theory. This is **visible**, **measurable**, **documented**.\n\nThis pattern didn’t just mirror the market — it mirrored the trauma cycles I mapped in my book *Cycles We Carry*. The same phases of breakdown and resistance I saw in movements and bodies were now flashing through Palantir’s chart.\n\nWhat I was tracking wasn’t random. It was resonance. The body knows the system because it’s lived it. If you’ve ever been in survival, in chaos, in control-based dynamics — you know what resistance feels like. You can sense when something is about to break.\n\nThat’s what this chart became: a nervous system on the brink. And it was my confirmation that we were entering a global cycle of escalation.\n\n---\n\n## I Was Watching the War Before It Started\n\nThe charts don’t lie. They show what the news hasn’t caught up to.\n\nPalantir’s price action told me something before the headlines did:\n\n> \n> **Global escalation is not coming. It’s already here.**\n> \n> \n> \n\nBecause Palantir doesn’t thrive in stability. It thrives in crisis. It profits from control, conflict, and compliance. And its chart is telling us that every institution betting on it is preparing for a future shaped by those forces.\n\nThe Human Chart Cycle warned us: resistance is the final grip before collapse. Palantir’s breakout isn’t just bullish sentiment — it’s a *signal* of what’s next.\n\nThe question isn’t just what the price says. It’s: *what is this price rise funding?* And what it’s funding is control systems, war contracts, and pre-emptive surveillance. Every candle on that chart is backed by algorithms designed to monitor, predict, and manage the public. The higher the chart climbs, the more embedded these tools become in daily life.\n\n---\n\n## The Architect Behind the System: Who Is Peter Thiel?\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_0000000080c861f79e4f9dc393e48b074255956870999687523.png?w=683)\n\nPalantir’s rise didn’t happen in a vacuum. It was engineered. And behind that engineering stands one man: **Peter Thiel**.\n\nA co-founder of PayPal, early investor in Facebook, and one of the most quietly powerful figures in tech, Thiel is no ordinary billionaire. He’s the architect of predictive control.\n\n- He co-founded Palantir in the post-9/11 surveillance wave.\n\n- He backed Trump. Funded hard-right political candidates.\n\n- He’s obsessed with AI, border control, authoritarian infrastructure, and even longevity tech.\n\n- He’s publicly questioned whether democracy and capitalism can coexist.\n\nThiel isn’t just making money. He’s shaping the architecture of modern obedience. Palantir is his flagship: a company that doesn’t just read data — it profiles, predicts, and pre-polices.\n\nThis is the machinery of forgetting. This is what I wrote about in *The Great Forgetting*. Because the system doesn’t just want to control you. It wants to erase the parts of you that would resist.\n\nPalantir is a forgetting engine. Thiel is its prophet. And the public is sleepwalking straight into the surveillance state with AI at the wheel.\n\n---\n\n## BlackRock: The Asset Manager of Collapse\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000b4c861fd8f56686e03ac3ce4579326683552775816.png?w=683)\n\nBut Peter Thiel didn’t do this alone. Palantir has heavyweight allies.\n\nEnter **BlackRock** — the largest asset manager on Earth.\n\nAs of 2025, BlackRock owns over **188 million shares** of Palantir, nearly **8.4%** of the company. This isn’t a casual investment. It’s strategic. Deliberate. And it places Palantir at the centre of a much bigger agenda.\n\nBlackRock recently launched a **defence-industrials ETF (IDEF)** — putting Palantir alongside Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and other war-market titans. The rationale? “Geopolitical fragmentation and AI warfare demand a new national security economy.”\n\nAnd BlackRock’s internal risk engine, **Aladdin**, doesn’t just track the market — it models the world. With over $21 trillion under management, it predicts climate threats, financial crashes, social instability. And now, its forecasts *include* the very tools (like Palantir) that will respond to those crises.\n\nThis is a closed loop:\n\n- BlackRock predicts collapse.\n\n- Palantir builds control systems to manage collapse.\n\n- BlackRock funds Palantir.\n\nIt’s not just investment. It’s **engineering the outcome**. This is how modern power works: silently, financially, algorithmically. And no one votes for it. No one even sees it — unless they’re tracking the charts.\n\n---\n\n## This Wasn’t Just Intuition. It Was Pattern Recognition.\n\nWhen I started tracking Palantir, I didn’t know what it did. But my body knew the rhythm. This wasn’t spiritual. It was structural.\n\nThe market moves like a nervous system. And I’ve lived in survival long enough to feel the shift before it lands. Palantir validated everything I’ve built:\n\n- That cycles repeat.\n\n- That collapse is forecastable.\n\n- That war doesn’t need to be announced to be active.\n\nAnd that if you pay attention to the right chart, you can see what’s coming.\n\nWe’re entering the final stages of resistance. The control systems are rallying. And if Palantir’s ATH tells us anything — it’s that collapse is closer than they’ll ever admit.\n\n**Watch the charts.** **Read the system.** **Because it’s already moving.**\n\n---\n\nThis article is the system layer. The data. The infrastructure. But if you want to understand what this moment feels like — what it’s doing to our nervous systems, our connections, our humanity — read it alongside:\n\n**The Great Forgetting — And Why the World Might Not Survive It.**\n\nTogether, these two pieces tell the full story:\n\n- The machinery of collapse.\n\n- And the soul that's slipping with it.\n\nThis is not just a crisis of power. It’s a crisis of memory.

That became *Three Days with a Predator* — a series that shook me to my core.\n\nNow it has happened again.\n\nAn Australian offender — not under pressure, not being pursued — came to me unprompted. A second predator. A second warning sign.\n\n*\"I am a danger to children,\"* he told me.\n*\"I would have sex with them. I do it rough.\"*\n\nThis is not a coincidence. It is becoming a pattern.\n\nAnd it exposes a terrifying reality: predators who know they are spiralling, who know they will offend again, are now turning to journalists and exposure groups — because they know the system won’t stop them.\n\n---\n\n## A System in Freefall\n\nI want to be clear: this is not vigilante work. This is not entertainment. This is public interest journalism — and what is happening here should alarm us all.\n\nWhen predators feel safer confessing to an independent journalist than facing the justice system, we have a problem.\n\nWhen those same predators openly state they will offend again unless physically stopped, we have a crisis.\n\nThis is now the second time an offender has sought me out to expose himself. Two cases, two countries, one undeniable pattern: offenders are spiralling, and the system is failing to catch them.\n\n---\n\n## The Contact\n\n*\"I want to be exposed.\"*\n\nThe message landed in my inbox without warning.\n\nI hadn’t approached him. He wasn’t caught by a sting. He wasn’t facing new charges.\n\nHe came to me — because he knew he was dangerous, and he knew no one else was going to stop him.\n\n*\"I am a danger to children,\"* he said.\n*\"Only jail, constant monitoring and public shaming would stop me.\"*\n\nConvicted in 2020 for four counts of using a carriage service to harass minors, he had received an 18-month suspended sentence and community service — a sentence he now described with contempt.\n\n*\"The system’s too soft,\"* he said.\n*\"People like me should be locked up for good, tracked 24/7, and publicly shamed so everyone knows who we are.\"*\n\nHe wasn’t saying this out of guilt. He was saying it because he was spiralling — and he knew it.\n\n---\n\n## The Escalation Pattern\n\nAs I questioned him, a disturbing layer emerged:\n\nHe wasn’t just contacting me. He had already approached multiple exposure groups, begging them to expose him.\n\n*\"I want to be exposed,\"* he told them too.\n\nThis was not a random impulse. It was an escalating behaviour — a predator aware he could no longer control his urges.\n\nProfessionals recognise this as an **escalation cycle**:\n\n- Guilt builds → compulsion builds → fantasy intensifies\n\n- The offender knows they are losing control\n\n- They seek external punishment or boundaries — because their internal boundaries are broken\n\nAnd when they do, the system has no effective response.\n\nIf they breach court orders, action may be triggered. But if they spiral publicly — contacting journalists, exposure groups, or the public — there is no guaranteed intervention.\n\nI saw this with Chris. I am seeing it again now.\n\nAnd the predators themselves know it.\n\n*\"Society doesn’t get how dangerous I am,\"* he told me.\n*\"They underestimate the risk.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Inside the Mind of a Predator\n\nWhat follows is a glimpse into the mind of a predator who knows exactly what he is, feels no hope of change — and sees no reason to stop unless forced.\n\nHis own words tell the story better than anything I could write:\n\n*\"I don’t even bother with excuses anymore,\"* he said.\n*\"I know my actions are disgusting and wrong — preying on kids who can’t fight back.\"*\n\n*\"Kids can’t consent, full stop,\"* he said.\n\nYet despite this clarity, the compulsion remains:\n\n*\"I only feel bad because I got caught, not because I actually care,\"* he admitted.\n*\"That’s how low I’ve sunk.\"*\n\nWhen asked whether he would stop if a child said no or showed fear:\n\n*\"I’d probably keep going — just easing up a bit.\"*\n\n*\"Only jail, constant monitoring and public shaming would stop me,\"* he repeated.\n\nHis view of his victims is equally chilling:\n\n*\"Most of my victims are just objects in my twisted headspace,\"* he said.\n\n*\"I fantasise about them daily.\"*\n*\"I panic when I see police warnings — but I keep going.\"*\n\nAnd he knows he is not alone:\n\n*\"Heaps of us are still out there,\"* he told me.\n*\"Hiding.\"*\n\n---\n\n## System Failure — and Public Risk Now\n\nThere is no question: this man is an active danger to children.\n\nHe knows it. I know it. Now — so do the police.\n\nFollowing his escalating admissions, I formally reported the full material to both UK Police and Australian Federal Police.\n\nI did not do this lightly. I did it because the risk is immediate and real.\n\nThis is not a man reflecting on historic crimes. This is a man actively seeking out child content, fantasising daily, and openly contacting exposure groups in a desperate bid to force the system to intervene.\n\nAnd so far — no action has been taken.\n\nWhen predators are left **begging to be stopped** and still walking free, that is a system in deep crisis.\n\nThis is now the second time this has happened to me as a journalist — and I fear it will not be the last.\n\nI will continue this series because the public needs to understand what is happening — and the system needs to be held accountable for its failure to act.\n\n*\"Heaps of us are still out there,\"* this man said.\n*\"Hiding.\"*\n\nThe real question is — why are we still letting them?\n\n---\n\n**Editorial Note:**\n\nFollowing receipt of these confessions, I formally referred the case to both UK Police and Australian Federal Police (Child Protection Operations) for urgent safeguarding review.\n\nThis series is being published in the public interest to expose critical systemic failures and to inform and protect the public.\n\n---","src/content/articles/part-1-inside-the-mind-of-a-predator-why-they-are-now-turning-to-journalists-for-exposure.md","147d87ecc264b826",{"html":2604,"metadata":2605},"\u003Cp>© By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>“Predators Are Slipping Through the Cracks — And They Are Coming to Me to Be Exposed.”\u003C/em>\n\u003Cem>A survivor-led investigative series documenting a new phase of systemic failure — when predators beg to be stopped, and the system does nothing.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image_editor_output_image-1821498421-1749584810013386549853756666661.jpg?w=900\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"i-want-to-be-exposed\">\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>“I want to be exposed.”\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>It was a message I never expected to receive once — let alone twice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Months ago, a UK predator approached me voluntarily — asking to be exposed.

They don’t threaten — they whisper comfort. They don’t always act fast — they wait, they learn, they adapt.\n\nTheir method?\n\n- Build trust\n\n- Create secrecy\n\n- Establish dependency\n\n- Introduce confusion\n\n- Cross boundaries slowly\n\n- Blur reality entirely\n\nAnd by the time the victim realises what’s happening, the emotional trap is already set.\n\n---\n\n## **“He Was Always So Kind” — The Mask That Works**\n\nThe Groomer can be:\n\n- The youth worker who gives special attention\n\n- The stepdad who’s “just really involved”\n\n- The man in the DMs offering validation\n\n- The older “boyfriend” who *understands her better than her parents do*\n\nWhat unites them is the ability to read needs — and weaponise them.\n\nThey identify gaps in confidence, love, attention, stability — then insert themselves as the solution.\n\nTo the outside world, they’re “caring.”\nTo the victim, they’re confusing.\nTo safeguarding systems, they’re often invisible.\n\nUntil it’s too late.\n\n---\n\n## **It’s Not Always About Age — It’s About Control**\n\nWhile grooming is often linked to child sexual abuse, it’s also used against adults. Survivors of domestic abuse, coercive control, or institutional exploitation have often been groomed too — just without anyone naming it.\n\nGrooming doesn’t require youth — it requires vulnerability.\nIt’s not about the victim being naïve. It’s about the predator being strategic.\n\n---\n\n## **Institutional Groomers**\n\nSome of the most dangerous groomers work inside the system.\n\n- Teachers\n\n- Clergy\n\n- Care workers\n\n- Foster carers\n\n- Police officers\n\n- Therapists\n\nThese predators use their position to disarm suspicion — and discredit victims. They frame concern as paranoia. They make children fear the consequences of speaking up. They create entire environments where they’re seen as heroes — while abusing in silence.\n\n---\n\n## **Why It Works So Well**\n\nBecause grooming isn’t just about the victim — it’s about everyone around them.\n\nThe predator doesn’t just win the child’s trust. He wins the trust of:\n\n- Parents (“He’s so kind to the kids”)\n\n- Colleagues (“He’s just got a good heart”)\n\n- Communities (“He’s always helping out”)\n\nBy the time a disclosure happens, it’s often met with disbelief — or worse, blame.\n\nAnd so the cycle continues.\n\n---\n\n## **What It Leaves Behind**\n\nThe impact of grooming goes beyond the physical. It infects identity, memory, and trust. Many survivors say the hardest part wasn’t the abuse — it was realising the person who made them feel safe was never real.\n\nThey mourn a version of someone who never existed.\n\n**Because grooming isn’t just abuse. It’s psychological fraud.**\n\n---\n\n## **We Have to Start Naming It**\n\nThe word “grooming” gets thrown around online — but in safeguarding, it’s still too often misunderstood or minimised. It’s not just manipulation. It’s methodical. It’s learned. It’s repeatable.\n\nAnd in the predator world, it’s currency.\n\nSome groomers go on to train others. Some share techniques in forums. Some test the limits until the system caves.\n\n**But make no mistake — grooming is not confusion. It is conquest.**\nAnd it doesn’t look like a monster.\nIt looks like a friend.\n\n---","src/content/articles/part-2-the-groomer-the-predator-who-poses-as-protection.md","5fd9637e8d85d0d3",{"html":2871,"metadata":2872},"\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_00000000110c620ab8b49b41f8a3614b4583010808907409668.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>He messaged every day.\nHe remembered her dog’s name.\nHe waited three weeks before bringing up sex.\nHe told her, \u003Cem>“You can talk to me about anything — I’m not like the others.”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He was lying.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is the Groomer.\nThe predator who doesn’t chase — he charms.\nWho doesn’t force — he flatters.\nAnd who doesn’t hurt \u003Cem>at first\u003C/em> — because the real pain comes later.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"predators-in-plain-sight\">\u003Cstrong>Predators in Plain Sight\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Groomers are often the most dangerous predators because they appear to be safe.\nThey don’t break into houses — they walk through the front door with a smile.

It was to *“expose others.”* He pointed to online spaces he said were “full of them,” and offered himself as a helpful witness.\n\nAt the same time, Eddie told me he is **under investigation in Greater Manchester**. In his own words, the allegations are **receiving and sending indecent images of children, and upskirting**. He agreed to answer my questions in full. What follows is drawn directly from that interview and from his written replies.\n\n> \n> **Eddie (on allegations):** “Receiving inappropriate images of children, and sending inappropriate images of children. Upskirting.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nHe denies being a danger. Yet across our exchange he repeatedly describes arousal at the sight of **girls in school uniform**, talks about **punishment and humiliation** as sexualised “relief,” and admits that **fear of exposure** is stronger than fear of prison.\n\nThis piece presents Eddie **in his own words**, followed by a clear, factual analysis of what those words indicate about risk and pattern. All claims are quoted or paraphrased from the interview material supplied above.\n\n---\n\n## Allegations and Denials — in His Words\n\nEddie’s stance is simple: *the thoughts exist, but he is “not attracted to children” and would “never act on it.”*\n\n- **Denial:** “I am not attracted to children… there [are] just thoughts I get. I would never act on it.”\n\n- **Repetition of denial under pressure:** “Am not a danger to anyone. I will never act on it. It’s fantasy.”\n\n- **Claimed limit:** “I don’t masturbate to them.”\n\nAlongside these denials are multiple admissions that contradict them:\n\n- **Triggers:** “Feeling can come back sometimes when I see schoolgirls.”\n\n- **Specific fetish cue:** “It’s the short skirts with no leggings or stockings… some skirts are too short.”\n\n- **“Darkest thought”:** “Having sex with a schoolgirl in uniform and other things.”\n\n- **Uniform arousal:** “I just get aroused seeing girls in uniform.”\n\nWhen asked the youngest age he has pictured sexually, he answers **“16.”** He also tries to displace the fixation into adult roleplay: if he wants that fantasy, he says, he would pay an adult to dress as a schoolgirl.\n\n---\n\n## Exposure, Punishment, Relief\n\nA second thread runs through Eddie’s replies: **humiliation as pseudo-control**.\n\n- **Punishment as ritual:** “I have visited a dominatrix to be punished for having nawty feelings and wearing panties.”\n\n- **Context:** “Yes, dressed as [a] sissy when she is punishing me.”\n\n- **On talking to me:** Asked whether speaking to me gives a similar rush, he answers: **“Yes.”**\n\n- **Fear calculus:** **“Fear of being exposed”** outweighs fear of prison.\n\nThe cycle he describes is consistent: **urge → punishment/exposure → temporary relief → return of urge**. He confirms the urges **return**; he cannot explain why.\n\n---\n\n## Projection and Control of the Narrative\n\nEddie repeatedly reframes himself as **ally/whistleblower**:\n\n- “These sites and the people running these sites need to be exposed.”\n\n- “My head is telling me to expose the people who need exposing.”\n\n- “They should get exposed, that’s why am helping you.”\n\nWhen asked why there are **multiple allegations** against him if he has “done nothing,” he replies: **“Can’t answer that.”**\n\n---\n\n## Attempt to Verify\n\nI approached **Greater Manchester Police** press office for a status check based on what Eddie told me. Their reply:\n\n> \n> “We can’t conduct searches on a name basis as per College of Policing guidance, however, if you can provide me with a DOB and a log / crime number that relates to the alleged incident in question, I might be able to access it that way.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nWithout a date of birth or crime reference, GMP could not confirm or deny the details Eddie described. Eddie’s statements therefore remain **his own claims** alongside the **allegations he himself set out**.\n\n---\n\n## Behavioural Red Flags (Based on the Interview Material)\n\nWhat follows is an analysis of **behavioural risk indicators** drawn directly from Eddie’s answers. It is **not** a medical or clinical diagnosis.\n\n**Persistent, cue-linked sexual ideation**\nHe acknowledges recurring arousal at **school uniforms** and says the feeling “can come back.” A stable stimulus-response pattern suggests **entrenchment**, not passing thought.\n\n**Minimisation and splitting**\nHe splits “thoughts” from “behaviour” and uses **“I don’t masturbate to them”** as a moral line. Minimisation in the face of multiple admissions is a known **risk marker**.\n\n**Eroticised humiliation / exposure**\nHe links urge relief to **punishment** (dominatrix) and **exposure**, and confirms that speaking to me produces a **similar rush**. That places **confession, punishment, and being “seen”** inside the cycle—**not** as deterrents but as reinforcers.\n\n**Compulsive outreach under active scrutiny**\nDespite stating he is under investigation, he **initiated contact** and answered questions that could harm him. Compulsive approach behaviour under risk suggests **impaired self-control**.\n\n**Projection / narrative capture**\nThe repeated insistence that he is “helping” expose others functions as **impression management** and a way to maintain access to exposure spaces while **de-centring** his own risk.\n\nTaken together, these markers align with a pattern I have documented across **two prior cases** (Chris and Matt): men who **seek out exposure** as part of the arousal/regulation loop. In this pattern, **shame is not a brake**; it is **part of the engine**.\n\n---\n\n## Why Displacement Isn’t Safety\n\nEddie argues that hiring an adult to dress as a schoolgirl makes the fantasy acceptable. In practice, this is **displacement**—a simulation that **preserves the template** (child-coded uniform, power dynamic, humiliation). Displacement can **reinforce** the cognitive and erotic script rather than dissolve it.\n\n---\n\n## The Systemic Gap\n\nEddie’s case also highlights a practical gap. Even when an interviewee:\n\n- sets out **allegations** in his own words,\n\n- admits **recurring arousal** linked to a child-coded cue, and\n\n- confirms **fear of exposure** over fear of prison,\n\n**verification remains closed** without bureaucratic keys (DOB, log number). Survivors face a wall; the public is asked to wait. Meanwhile, individuals like Eddie can **continue to enter exposure spaces** and **shape their own narrative**.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEddie insists: **“I’m not a danger to anyone.”**\nYet his **darkest thought** involves a **schoolgirl in uniform**.\nHis **urges recur** at that cue.\nHis **relief** comes through **punishment and exposure**.\nHis **strongest stated fear** is **people finding out**.\n\nOn the evidence of this interview alone, Eddie’s behaviour fits a **recognisable exposure-seeking pattern**: confession as performance; shame as arousal; punishment as temporary sedation; projection as cover.\n\nThis is not about one man. It is an emerging **offender pattern** we must name plainly. Until we stop mistaking **confession for accountability**, exposure for change, and displacement for safety, cases like Eddie’s will continue to orbit public spaces under the veneer of “helping.”\n\nWe can’t look away. We also can’t afford to be fooled by the performance.\n\n---\n\n### Right of Reply\n\n- **Greater Manchester Police** were approached and said they cannot confirm or deny details without a date of birth or crime/log reference.\n\n- **Eddie** was invited to clarify any factual inaccuracies in this piece; his quoted replies above are reproduced from his own messages.\n\n- Any subject named in this article may submit a **formal response** for publication.","src/content/articles/part-2-inside-the-mind-of-eddie-b.md","c545a4c1ea777ad2",{"html":2915,"metadata":2916},"\u003Cp>© By Sophie Lewis | NUJ | Journalist | The Grooming Files\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot_20251009_231411_com_openai_chatgpt_mainactivity4737574657708612549.jpg?w=1016\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"a-case-study-in-exposure-seeking-behaviour\">A Case Study in Exposure-Seeking Behaviour\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"when-eddie-b-first-contacted-me-it-wasnt-to-confess-or-apologise-it-was-to-expose-others-he-pointed-to-online-spaces-he-said-were-full-of-them-and-offered-himself-as-a-helpful-witness\">When \u003Cstrong>Eddie B\u003C/strong> first contacted me, it wasn’t to confess or apologise.

Surface Presentation\n\nEddie positions himself as cooperative and even helpful:\n\n- “Sure.” (when asked if he would answer questions)\n\n- “That I have helped in exposing people.”\n\nHe frames himself as both victim (“I am not attracted to children… there [are] just thoughts I get”) and ally (“These sites and the people running these sites need to be exposed”). This dual positioning is classic **impression management** — he attempts to control how he is seen while allowing “safe” admissions to leak out.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Contradictions\n\nEddie repeatedly denies attraction to children:\n\n- “I am not attracted to children, there just thoughts I get. I would never act on it.”\n\nYet he simultaneously admits to arousal and fantasy:\n\n- “Feeling can come back sometimes when I see schoolgirls.”\n\n- “It’s the short skirts with no leggings or stockings… some skirts are too short.”\n\n- “Having sex with a schoolgirl in uniform and other things.”\n\n- “I just get aroused seeing girls in uniform.”\n\nHe attempts to reduce the risk by separating thoughts from behaviour:\n\n- “No, because I don’t masturbate to them.”\n\nIn forensic psychology, persistent sexual fantasies — especially when linked to specific triggers such as uniforms — are themselves a high-risk marker, regardless of whether masturbation occurs. This contradiction between denial and admission is central to his profile.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Exposure & Shame–Arousal Cycle\n\nEddie’s disclosures reveal a ritualised link between urges, punishment, and confession:\n\n- “I have visited a dominatrix to be punished… for having nawty feelings and wearing panties.”\n\n- “Yes, dressed as sissy when she is punishing me.”\n\n- “I just seem to get aroused… but I don’t masturbate to them.”\n\nExposure becomes part of this cycle:\n\n- “Fear of being exposed.” (when asked what is more powerful than fear of police)\n\n- “If I get exposed… I will be relieved when it’s over.”\n\nThis mirrors the **exposure-seeking predator typology**: urges emerge, exposure or humiliation is sought, temporary relief follows, and then the cycle repeats. For Eddie, confession and punishment are not deterrents — they are eroticised components of the compulsion.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Fantasy Displacement\n\nWhen confronted, Eddie reframes his schoolgirl fetish into adult roleplay:\n\n- “If I want that fantasy, I’ll pay for [an] adult to dress [as a] schoolgirl for me.”\n\nHe presents this as a moral defence (“adult yes, child no”), but the fetish template remains anchored in children in uniform. This is **fantasy displacement**: redirecting urges into simulations that appear “safer” but in practice reinforce the fixation. Displacement does not neutralise risk — it entrenches it.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Blame & Projection\n\nEddie persistently shifts attention away from himself:\n\n- “These sites and the people running these sites need to be exposed.”\n\n- “My head is telling me to expose the people who need exposing.”\n\n- “These people who prey on children online, it’s disgusting.”\n\nThis is projection — reframing himself as aligned with safeguarding, while minimising his own risk. It serves to reduce personal accountability and maintain access to exposure communities under the guise of “helping.”\n\n---\n\n## 6. Risk Markers\n\nSeveral markers elevate Eddie’s profile to **current high-risk**:\n\n- **Active CPS investigation**: “Allegations are receiving inappropriate images of children, and sending inappropriate images of children. Upskirting.”\n\n- **Compulsive disclosure**: despite investigation, he reached out voluntarily, knowing it could incriminate him.\n\n- **Persistent urges**: “Feeling can come back sometimes when I see schoolgirls.”\n\n- **Minimisation**: “No, because I don’t masturbate to them.”\n\n- **Contradictions**: denies attraction, then admits “Having sex with a schoolgirl in uniform” as darkest fantasy.\n\n- **Fear dynamics**: “Fear of being exposed” outweighs fear of prison.\n\nThese behaviours suggest impaired self-control, escalating compulsion, and reliance on external punishment rather than internal inhibition.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Core Typology Fit\n\nEddie aligns with multiple offender subtypes:\n\n- **Exposure-Seeking Predator** — derives arousal from risk, shame, punishment, and being “seen.”\n\n- **Denier–Minimiser** — insists he is “not attracted” while confessing explicit fantasies.\n\n- **Projectionist** — reframes himself as someone helping to expose others.\n\n- **Shame-Control Loop** — uses dominatrix punishment, humiliation, and confession as pseudo-control mechanisms.\n\nThis combination suggests an offender profile where exposure itself is fetishised, risk is displaced rather than reduced, and accountability is externalised.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Key Insights\n\n- Eddie’s claim to be “helping” is a defensive mask, allowing him to stay in exposure spaces while presenting as an ally.\n\n- His compulsive outreach under active CPS investigation is evidence of **escalation**, not restraint.\n\n- The fixation on school uniforms recurs throughout his answers, anchoring the core fetish.\n\n- His strongest stated fear is not prison but exposure — indicating that shame itself is eroticised, not deterrent.\n\n- He is psychologically addicted to being caught. Exposure is part of the ritual cycle, not a deterrent.\n\n---\n\n## Professional Summary\n\nEddie B presents as a **high-risk, exposure-seeking offender** whose behaviours are rooted in a shame–arousal–punishment cycle. Despite minimising his attraction (“I am not attracted to children”), his repeated admissions of arousal at schoolgirls in uniform, his darkest fantasy involving a schoolgirl, and his compulsive need for punishment demonstrate ongoing risk.\n\nExposure, humiliation, and confession function as eroticised relief mechanisms rather than deterrents. His repeated projections (“these sites need exposing, not me”) indicate avoidance of accountability.\n\nEddie represents a dangerous pattern within the emerging typology of **exposure-seeking predators**: individuals who do not fear consequence but eroticise it, who oscillate between denial and confession, and who remain psychologically compelled to place themselves in cycles of risk.\n\n---","src/content/articles/part-3-psychological-profile-eddie-b.md","f3db142c499afca7",{"html":3054,"metadata":3055},"\u003Cp>© By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot_20251009_231411_com_openai_chatgpt_mainactivity2696423672140679933.jpg?w=1016\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"1-surface-presentation\">1.

And it is happening right now.\"\n\n---\n\nIt should not be happening at all.\n\nPredators — in an active escalation spiral — openly admitting they will offend again — contacting journalists and groups because they know they are dangerous — and still walking free.\n\nBut it is happening.\n\nI have now documented two such cases — in two countries — and I am hearing it is happening more.\n\nPredators who know they are spiralling are turning to exposure groups, to journalists, to the public — because the systems meant to protect children are failing to intervene.\n\nAnd what happens next is even more alarming.\n\n---\n\n## The Groups Are Not Ready\n\nMany exposure groups run on the same basic model:\nCatch a predator contacting a decoy child\nBuild a chat log\nArrange a confrontation\nDeliver a clear public outcome\n\nIt works — in those cases.\n\nBut exposure-seeking predators do not fit this model.\n\nThey do not arrive via chat logs. They do not attempt a meet.\nThey come unprompted — already spiralling — already seeking external punishment or control.\n\nAnd the groups are not equipped to handle it.\n\nWhen Matt — the Australian offender at the centre of this case — began spiralling, he contacted multiple exposure groups in both Australia and the UK.\n\n*\"I want to be exposed,\"* he told them.\n\nAnd what happened?\nSome ignored him.\nSome engaged briefly, then backed away.\nNone took clear or coordinated action to escalate the risk.\n\nThe result? Matt kept spiralling.\n\nBy the time he reached me, he had already openly admitted to:\nOngoing sexual fantasies about children\nActively masturbating to images of real children on public platforms\nHaving taken a sexualised photo of a child in public\nWillingness to rape a child if given the opportunity\n\nAnd still — no intervention had occurred.\n\nThis is not a criticism of individual groups.\nIt is a criticism of a system that has no coherent response for this phase of risk.\n\nExposure groups were never designed to handle this type of offender.\n\nAnd unless they adapt — carefully and ethically — they risk leaving the most dangerous predators free to spiral unchecked.\n\n*\"When a person begins spiralling into risk behaviour, early intervention is critical. Waiting for an offence to occur means we have already failed the child.\"*\n— **NSPCC Chief Executive Sir Peter Wanless**\n\n---\n\n## The Police Are Missing the Window\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000e98c6243af3141b7f640ea813866219323812898372.png?w=683)\n\nLaw enforcement faces a different — but equally dangerous — blindspot.\n\nIf a predator is not breaching a court order — not committing a clear new offence — there is often no legal pathway to intervene swiftly.\n\nExposure-seeking behaviour — openly contacting journalists or groups — is not currently classified as an actionable offence.\n\nBut it should be treated as a red flag.\n\nIn Matt’s case:\nI reported him formally to UK Police and to Australian Federal Police.\nI documented that he was actively seeking exposure because he knew he would offend again.\n\nAnd at the time of writing — Matt remains free.\n\nHe knows it, too.\n\nIn the days after his interview, he began messaging me again — not to apologise, but to backpedal and minimise:\n\n*\"I wouldn’t actually do it,\"* he said — after openly stating on record that he would.\n\n*\"I feel bad about it,\"* he added — after stating on record that he only felt bad because he was caught.\n\nAnd in one chilling moment of clarity, he asked me:\n\n*\"Is there anyone that would do paedophile monitoring — reporting, check-ups, location monitoring — breaches reported to police?\"*\n\nHe knew the system was not stopping him.\nHe was trying to force someone — anyone — to.\n\nAnd still, no action.\n\n*\"The compulsion to offend online escalates rapidly without intervention, often driving offenders to take greater risks — including public or semi-public exposure of their behaviour.\"*\n— **Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation (ACCCE)**\n\n---\n\n## Why This Is Happening Now\n\nWhy now?\n\nBecause we have created a generation of predators whose compulsions were fed online from an early age — unchecked — while systems failed to catch up.\n\nThe explosion of child-accessible content, the collapse of meaningful digital monitoring, and the rise of self-reinforcing online communities have driven predators to the point where they now spiral publicly — seeking exposure, forced intervention, or even gratification from being caught.\n\nThis is a new phase of predator psychology — one born of the digital age — and it is happening in multiple countries, right now.\n\n---\n\n## A New Phase of Offender Behaviour — And a New Risk\n\nThis is not about Matt.\nIt is not about the first predator I documented.\n\nIt is about a new phase of offender behaviour that no one is ready for:\n\nPredators spiralling into exposure-seeking\nContacting multiple groups and journalists\nTrying to force external intervention — or worse, deriving a twisted gratification from the exposure process itself\nRemaining free — and dangerous — while the system struggles to respond\n\nI am hearing of this happening more — across multiple countries — and I will continue to document it.\n\nBecause right now — the public is not being protected.\n\n---\n\n## The Public Danger — Right Now\n\nWhile groups debate how to handle these cases — and police wait for legal thresholds to be crossed — predators like Matt remain free.\n\nAnd in that window of freedom, they are:\nFantasising daily\nSeeking out child content online\nContacting exposure groups\nAttempting to trigger public exposure\nAdmitting they would offend if not stopped\n\nThis is not a theoretical risk.\nIt is an immediate, active threat to children.\n\nAnd ignoring it will not make it go away.\n\n---\n\n## What Must Change — Now\n\nWe must:\nImmediate development of legal pathways for police to act on exposure-seeking behaviour — not after an offence, but at the point of clear escalation.\nProfessional training and protocols for exposure groups — so they can handle these cases ethically and escalate them properly.\nCoordinated safeguarding responses — this cannot be left to fragmented volunteer groups and individual journalists.\nPublic awareness — parents, professionals, and communities must understand that this pattern is happening NOW.\n\n---\n\n## The Fight Is Not

They aren’t confused about boundaries.

This is about domination.\nPain is their language. Suffering is their control.\n\n---\n\n## **“She Didn’t Say No” — Consent as Camouflage**\n\nMany Sadists use the illusion of consent to mask the reality of abuse. They may draw victims into their orbit with charm or sexual curiosity — only to push far beyond agreed limits. And when victims cry, freeze, or dissociate, the predator claims it was all part of the act.\n\n> \n> *“She liked it rough.”*\n> *“She never said stop.”*\n> *“It was BDSM.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nBut what separates consensual kink from sadistic abuse is simple: **safety, agreement, and care.**\nSadists don’t care if it hurts — they *want* it to.\n\nSome go further: forcing acts the victim explicitly refused. Branding. Beating. Anal penetration against will. Public humiliation. Recording without consent. These acts aren’t about sex — they’re about erasure. Making someone disappear inside themselves.\n\n---\n\n## **Where They Hide**\n\nSadists exist across all walks of life. But certain environments offer more cover:\n\n- Prisons\n\n- Military\n\n- Institutions\n\n- Relationships where trauma bonding has already begun\n\n- Online spaces where extreme content becomes currency\n\nSome Sadists gain status among peers for how far they’ll go. Others work alone, feeding dark fantasies in silence — until they spill out into real life.\n\nAnd some blend into kink communities not to explore safely, but to exploit the language of submission and trust.\n\n---\n\n## **The Survivor’s Body Becomes Evidence**\n\nUnlike some other predator types, Sadists often leave physical proof: bruises, injuries, trauma that requires medical care. Yet many victims stay silent. Why?\n\nBecause they were gaslit into believing they asked for it.\nBecause they fear no one will understand the difference between *rough sex* and *ritual humiliation*.\nBecause the predator was someone they loved — or feared.\n\nAnd when survivors do speak, they often hear:\n\n> \n> “Why didn’t you leave?”\n> “Why didn’t you fight back?”\n> “You stayed though, didn’t you?”\n> \n> \n> \n\nThat’s the power of psychological domination.\nThe victim doesn’t just endure pain — they become convinced they deserve it.\n\n---\n\n## **Sadism Is Not Just a Preference. It’s a Pattern.**\n\nThe Sadist doesn’t get bored — he escalates.\nWhat starts with “accidental” choking can move to rape. What begins with filmed slapping can turn into group violence. Sadistic predators push limits until something breaks — often the victim, sometimes the law.\n\nThey test reactions. They push boundaries.\nAnd when no one stops them, they go further.\n\n---\n\n## **We Don’t Want to Believe They Exist. That’s Why They Do.**\n\nSadistic predators thrive on silence. On society’s discomfort. On our fear of confronting the darkest end of sexual violence. But naming them matters — because they leave a very specific kind of scar.\n\nOne where the body heals, but the soul never forgets the moment someone looked into their eyes — and smiled while hurting them.\n\n**This isn’t sex. This is soul theft.**\n\nAnd too many get away with it.\n\n---","src/content/articles/part-3-the-sadist-he-doesnt-want-sex-he-wants-to-watch-you-break.md","6b53571c8304dd8d",{"html":3189,"metadata":3190},"\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_0000000092e8620ab3eb779c9334ec0a281291297219222812313210.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>He didn’t just hurt her.\nHe recorded it.\nWatched it back.\nSent it to others.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And then he blamed her for bleeding.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is the Sadist — the predator who thrives not on pleasure, but on suffering.

He doesn’t have to.\n\nThe Networker predator isn’t just abusing — he’s collaborating. Trading. Recruiting. Sharing techniques. He operates like a businessman, a trafficker, a strategist. And sometimes, like a friend.\n\nBut make no mistake: behind the friendly chat, the dark web logins, and the harmless-sounding usernames, is an economy of exploitation. And he’s one of its builders.\n\n---\n\n## **Not Just a User — A Supplier, a Strategist, a Link in the Chain**\n\nThe Networker doesn’t seek only gratification. He seeks *connection* — with other predators.\nTo normalise what he’s doing.\nTo prove he’s not alone.\nTo show off, escalate, or profit.\n\nYou’ll find him in:\n\n- Encrypted Telegram or Kik groups\n\n- Hidden forums and invite-only Discords\n\n- Peer-to-peer file sharing networks\n\n- Deep web boards where “collections” are catalogued and traded\n\n- DMs with grooming tips passed like recipes\n\nHe may not create abuse images — but he downloads them. He may not initiate abuse — but he enables it. He teaches others how to cover their tracks, hide drives, or speak in code.\n\n---\n\n## **From Watcher to Facilitator**\n\nSome Networkers begin by collecting.\nThen uploading.\nThen distributing.\nThen organising.\nSome move into active abuse themselves, emboldened by the community around them. Others stay behind the scenes — digital fixers, gatekeepers, enablers.\n\nThey may call it a “fandom,” a “map community,” or “non-contact support.”\nBut make no mistake: this is a criminal underworld, often hiding behind euphemisms and false morality.\n\nAnd it’s growing.\n\n---\n\n## **This Predator Looks Nothing Like You Expect**\n\nThe Networker can be:\n\n- A lonely teenager\n\n- A respected professional\n\n- A parent\n\n- A teacher\n\n- A man in his 60s who still lives with his mother\n\n- A tech-savvy 20-something with no prior record\n\nThe unifying trait? **They know how to hide.**\nThey may use virtual machines, offshore VPNs, encryption, timed self-deleting messages, or air-gapped devices.\nAnd when caught, they often say:\n\n> \n> “I never touched anyone.”\n> “It was just curiosity.”\n> “It’s not the same as real abuse.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nBut every image is a crime scene.\nEvery download is an act of violence.\nAnd every share re-victimises a real person.\n\n---\n\n## **When the Network Is Bigger Than the Law**\n\nOne of the most terrifying aspects of this typology is how far the reach can go.\n\n- Some Networkers operate across continents.\n\n- Some hold jobs in law enforcement or safeguarding.\n\n- Some are actively involved in creating and distributing illegal content from within institutional systems.\n\nThe law can barely keep up.\nDark web forums get taken down — and another appears.\nFiles get traced — but mirrors exist in multiple countries.\nSome predators get banned from platforms — and reappear under a new name within hours.\n\nWe are not dealing with individual deviants.\nWe are dealing with **infrastructure**.\n\n---\n\n## **The Myth of the Harmless Downloader**\n\nToo often, courts treat “non-contact offenders” as lesser. But every click fuels demand. Every share supports abuse. And many so-called non-contact Networkers are grooming, engaging in fantasy chats with children, or escalating in private.\n\nThey’re not passive.\nThey’re planners.\nAnd they are extremely dangerous.\n\n---\n\n## **How Do You Fight What’s Invisible?**\n\nThe hardest part of tackling the Networker isn’t finding the predator — it’s finding the network.\nMany operate in secrecy for years.\nSome never get caught.\nOthers are exposed only after enormous damage.\n\nAnd victims? They don’t always know the predator’s name. But their images are still out there — passed around like files, watched by thousands, long after the abuse ends.\n\n**The harm is digital. The trauma is permanent.**\n\n---\n\n## **This Is the Predator You Don’t See — Until the Files Are Found**\n\nHe could be anyone.\nBecause the Networker isn’t defined by how he looks.\nHe’s defined by what he builds.\n\n**And what he builds is a system of harm.**\n\n---","src/content/articles/part-5-the-networker-the-predator-who-builds-a-world-of-harm.md","5e37cc7268cb5eb9",{"html":3317,"metadata":3318},"\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_00000000d9e46246a7d5becf8262349f6012166532255021079.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>He doesn’t act alone.

Fake orgasms. Choking. Humiliation. Silence.\n\nNot love.

They’re strategic inactioners. They *choose* not to report. Not to challenge. Not to act.\nThey might be:\n\n- A parent who ignores the child’s disclosure\n\n- A colleague who doesn’t log the safeguarding concern\n\n- A manager who dismisses the warning signs\n\n- A friend who says “don’t ruin his life over a mistake”\n\n- An officer who files it as “non-crime” despite clear risk\n\nWhether motivated by loyalty, fear, denial, or self-preservation, the outcome is the same: **the predator is protected, and the victim is left to bleed in silence.**\n\n---\n\n## **Why They Don’t Act — and Why It’s Still Abuse**\n\nBystander-Predators often justify their silence:\n\n> \n> “I didn’t know for sure.”\n> “It’s not my business.”\n> “It’s not serious enough.”\n> “They’re probably lying.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nBut what they really mean is:\n\n> \n> “It’s easier to doubt the victim than confront the predator.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nAnd their silence **isn’t neutral**. It’s a decision that allows abuse to continue — unchecked.\n\n---\n\n## **When Silence Turns into Collaboration**\n\nIn many cases, the Bystander isn’t just silent — they become active protectors:\n\n- Deleting messages\n\n- Dismissing safeguarding referrals\n\n- Blaming the victim\n\n- Helping predators relocate or “start over”\n\n- Threatening those who speak out\n\nIn institutions — schools, churches, councils, even police forces — this becomes systemic. Whole teams shield one abuser out of “reputation management.”\n\nOne predator can harm.\nA bystander makes sure they can do it again.\n\n---\n\n## **We All Know One**\n\nThis is the most common predator type that “doesn’t feel like one.”\nBut their impact is real, repeatable, and devastating.\n\nNo predator thrives in isolation.\nThey’re enabled — by silence.\n\n---","src/content/articles/part-9-the-bystander-predator-when-silence-protects-the-abuser.md","5b97249a8e30f798",{"html":3622,"metadata":3623},"\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file-7fdnsuhg5gaaiishgej1xo281294512320953576729070.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>He didn’t touch anyone.\nHe didn’t send the message.\nHe didn’t commit the crime.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But he saw the signs.\nHe heard the disclosures.\nHe knew what was happening.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And he did nothing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is the \u003Cstrong>Bystander-Predator\u003C/strong> — the silent accomplice.

But instead of engagement or challenge, he received a phone call that has since sent ripples through the advocacy community.\n\n---\n\n## “Take it down — or face arrest”\n\nDuring the call, which Tom states was recorded, an officer reportedly told him:\n\n*\"If you don’t remove the post, we will arrest you.\"*\n\nNo formal charge. No warrant. No demonstrated breach of law, just an ultimatum. Remove the post, or risk losing your liberty.\n\nTom is now seeking legal advice and standing firm.\n\n---\n\n### What was in the post?\n\nThe post in question contained material Tom believed to be both **truthful** and **in the public interest**.\n\nIt did not include threats, abuse, or targeted harassment, the elements typically required to meet the legal threshold for a “malicious communications” offence.\n\nIt was, simply, a piece of advocacy, the kind of speech protected by both UK law and basic human rights standards.\n\n---\n\n## The wider danger\n\nThreatening campaigners or journalists with **arrest for publishing verified information** is not just a legal overstep. It’s an attack on public interest speech itself.\n\nWhen officers issue ultimatums like this without court oversight or formal charge, they risk eroding both **free expression** and **public trust in policing**.\n\nMalicious communications laws were never intended to shield uncomfortable truths from public view.\n\n---\n\n## Statement from Predator Awareness\n\nIn a statement, Predator Awareness said:\n\n> \n> *“The post in question contained factual information supported by evidence.

Gathered outside **BBC MediaCity in Salford** for a peaceful demonstration against institutional silence, complicity, and decades of cover-ups. What unfolded was more than just a protest — it was **a confrontation between truth and an institution protected by the state**.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17428421126543678551040109212282.jpg?w=1024)\n\nWhat the BBC didn’t expect was **the unwavering resilience of those who’ve had enough**. And what the protesters didn’t expect? **To be physically confronted by BBC staff**. A £200 protest banner pole? **Damaged**. Their speaker, which carried survivor voices and rally calls, **confiscated**. The BBC, which claims impartiality and public service, responded to a peaceful protest with hostility, damage, and silence.\n\nBut here’s the truth: **These groups are not here for permission**. They’re here for **accountability**.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17428426261748168498323060011040.jpg?w=1024)\n\n---\n\n### **The Reality of Institutional Betrayal**\n\nFor the protesters standing outside MediaCity, this wasn’t just another protest. It was **an act of defiance against decades of systemic failings**, where powerful institutions like the BBC have used their media empire to silence the most vulnerable — survivors of abuse.\n\n**Predator Awareness** has spent over six years fighting for those whose voices have been drowned out by a corporate machine that thrives on maintaining a polished image. From the darkest days of **Jimmy Savile** to the recent failures surrounding **Huw Edwards**, the BBC has shown a blatant disregard for the victims it should protect. Instead, it has shielded perpetrators and spun a narrative of innocence.\n\nThe group’s mission? **To expose the lies. Tear down the facade. Demand justice for the victims ignored by institutions like the BBC.**\n\nTom Blewitt, founder of **Predator Awareness**, didn’t mince words: *“We are here today because we’ve had enough of the BBC’s lies. Enough of their silence. Enough of their complicity in hiding predators.”* His words resonated deeply with countless survivors whose lives have been shattered by the system that should protect them.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17428423929031948715932801920414.jpg?w=1024)*Tom Blewitt - Founder of Predator Awareness *\n\n---\n\n### **The BBC's Response to Protesters**\n\nBut the BBC didn’t just ignore the protesters. They **actively sought to shut them down**.\n\nSecurity, hired by the BBC, didn’t come to ensure safety. They came to intimidate. **The protestors’ banner was damaged. A £200 pole was damaged. The speaker — a tool for amplifying the truth — was taken**. The protesters were accused of causing criminal damage, while the BBC staff acted as if they were the victims. A chilling reminder that when powerful institutions feel threatened, they use whatever power they can muster to suppress the truth.\n\nThis wasn’t just oppression — it was **institutional gaslighting**, a tactic that has become the hallmark of the BBC’s approach to scandals it tries to bury.\n\n---\n\n### **The Fight Beyond the Protest: Unseen Battles and Unwavering Resilience**\n\nThe truth doesn’t just live in the streets outside **BBC MediaCity**. For **Zack Griffiths**, **Tom Blewitt**, and the **HMP Prisons Justice Group**, this battle goes much deeper. It’s a fight not just against corruption but against the forces that seek to silence them. They’ve been threatened, marginalised, and ignored. Some have been smeared as “troublemakers,” “conspiracy theorists,” or “extremists” — all for speaking the truth.\n\nThe emotional toll is profound. The weight of systemic abuse, emotional manipulation, and apathy has nearly broken them. But they keep pushing forward.\n\n**Zack Griffiths**, who leads **HMP Prisons Justice Group**, has long been advocating for prisoners subjected to abuse and systemic neglect. He wasn’t looking for a fight; he was looking for justice for those whose stories have been suppressed. *“This isn’t just about one protest. This is about the years of work, the lives we’ve changed, and the survivors we’ve fought for,”* Zack said. *“This is for the kids who never had a chance to speak. For the families who lost everything.”*\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17428426324527180909771405024039.jpg?w=768)*Zack (left) with a supporter of the group! *\n\n---\n\n### **The Movement Grows: From Protest to Power**\n\nThe protest outside **BBC MediaCity** was a flashpoint. But it’s far from the end of the battle. **Predator Awareness** and **HMP Prisons Justice Group** are more than protest groups. They are movements. And movements don’t fade; they grow, evolve, and gain strength with every person who steps forward.\n\nAfter the demonstration, the response from the public was overwhelming. **Messages flooded in** from people who’d been waiting for someone to speak out — from victims hiding their pain, from families who watched helplessly as their loved ones were failed by a broken system. They were calling for justice, truth, and accountability — and pledging their support for the groups leading the charge.\n\nThis protest sparked **a new wave of voices**, many from people who never imagined standing up to the BBC, but now realised they had no choice. And the message was clear: **They’re not going anywhere**. The battle for justice will continue, no matter the obstacles.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17428426347929134441573947252748.jpg?w=1024)\n\n---\n\n### **Predator Awareness: Reclaiming What Was Stolen**\n\nThe growing support shows that **Predator Awareness** and **HMP Prisons Justice Group** are **beacons of hope** for the overlooked and the silenced. They are amplifying the voices that have been drowned out for too long — the voices of survivors, the voices of forgotten victims, the voices the BBC would rather keep quiet.\n\nBut this fight isn’t over. **Not by a long shot**.\n\n---\n\n### **Where to Find More Information and Support**\n\nFor those wanting to learn more about the incredible work done by **Predator Awareness** and the **HMP Prisons Justice Group**, as well as access the speeches and recordings from the protest, you can find them through the following channels:\n\n- **Predator Awareness Website**: [www.predatorawareness.co.uk](https://www.predatorawareness.co.uk)\n\n- **HMP Prisons Justice Group**: https://hmpjusticegroup.wordpress.com/\n\nFor video highlights, speeches from the protest, and more in-depth coverage, visit the [Predator Awareness ](https://www.facebook.com/share/12HvUJ5hVE4/) social media platforms. \n\n**Together, we demand truth, justice, and accountability.**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17432591496741973998672031587699.jpg?w=918)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_1742842630519226094796698439717.jpg?w=768)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17389725305416607618378084714887.jpg?w=960)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/screenshot_20250218_204614_com_facebook_katana_mediagalleryactivity2908931268371967451.jpg?w=1024)","src/content/articles/predator-awareness-and-hmp-prisons-justice-group-stand-tall-after-assault-at-mediacity.md","fe99a48833032d32",{"html":3868,"metadata":3869},"\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis - @realtalkrealtea\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17432591469632719544264820251131.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>On Saturday, 29th March 2025\u003C/strong>, grassroots justice campaigners from \u003Cstrong>Predator Awareness\u003C/strong> and the \u003Cstrong>HMP Prisons Justice Group\u003C/strong>, led by \u003Cstrong>Tom Blewitt\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>Zack Griffiths\u003C/strong>.

She told teachers, doctors, and social workers about the abuse she faced. She showed them bruises. She tried to name the men. And now, a leaked cache of restricted social services files — recently surfaced online — confirms what many feared: Charlene was failed not just once, but repeatedly, by every institution meant to protect her.\n\n---\n\n### **A Trail of Warnings (1998–2000)**\n\nCharlene's story doesn’t begin with her disappearance. It begins years earlier, in council reports and health records documenting a pattern of abuse, neglect, and institutional silence.\n\nAccording to the leaked documents, social workers in Coventry and later Blackpool had concerns about the Downes family as far back as 1989. By 1998, it was reported that Charlene and one of her siblings alleged sexual abuse by someone close to the family. A doctor reportedly examined one of the children and suspected serious abuse. No charges followed. No child protection order. Just more notes added to an already growing file.\n\nIn 2000, Charlene, then just 11 years old, disclosed that her father had thrown her across a room. When she vanished for two days afterward, it was marked as a concern — but again, no action was taken. That same year, Charlene was reportedly allowed to stay overnight at strangers' homes. One adult was later reported to have engaged in inappropriate conduct with the child. Authorities were informed. Nothing happened.\n\n---\n\n### **Known Risks, Missed Warnings**\n\nThe documents reference a number of adults known to frequent the household — some with concerning histories. One social services record describes an environmental officer entering the home and allegedly finding an older man pulling up his trousers in the same room as Charlene. The matter was closed due to \"lack of cooperation.\"\n\nOthers, suspected of inappropriate behaviour or known past offences, were also reportedly given unrestricted access to the children. Despite concerns being recorded across agencies, little action followed.\n\n---\n\n### **Health and Medical Red Flags**\n\nCharlene attended a local Walk-In Centre **13 times in 12 months**. Injuries included bruising to her inner thighs. One visit was reportedly prompted by a family member who suspected abuse. Findings were passed to social services. Still, no safeguarding intervention occurred.\n\n---\n\n### **A Home of Fear**\n\nThe files describe a household dominated by control, instability, and silence. Charlene’s father was allegedly feared by family members. Reports mention domestic violence, alcohol abuse, and frequent visits by adult males. Charlene and her siblings made disclosures about inappropriate behaviour and their parents’ failure to protect them.\n\nEven when Charlene was placed into foster care, concerns remained. She hinted at abuse but missed home. Notes were written. Files updated. Still, she was returned.\n\n---\n\n### **The Final Year (2003)**\n\nAs her disappearance approached, the warnings escalated. Charlene was reportedly involved in adult environments, allegedly exchanging favours for money.

She told teachers, doctors, and social workers about the abuse she faced. She showed them bruises. She tried to name the men.

It begins years earlier, in council reports and health records documenting a pattern of abuse, neglect, and institutional silence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>According to the leaked documents, social workers in Coventry and later Blackpool had concerns about the Downes family as far back as 1989. By 1998, it was reported that Charlene and one of her siblings alleged sexual abuse by someone close to the family. A doctor reportedly examined one of the children and suspected serious abuse. No charges followed. No child protection order. Just more notes added to an already growing file.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 2000, Charlene, then just 11 years old, disclosed that her father had thrown her across a room. When she vanished for two days afterward, it was marked as a concern — but again, no action was taken. That same year, Charlene was reportedly allowed to stay overnight at strangers’ homes. One adult was later reported to have engaged in inappropriate conduct with the child. Authorities were informed.

You're anti-progress. You're not sex-positive.\"*\n\n---\n\n## How Porn Culture Filters Into Class\n\nThis isn’t accidental.\nWhen children are sexualised by culture and online content (Parts 1 and 2), education is the final layer that can either: ✅ **Challenge it.**\n❌ **Normalise it.**\n\nRight now, many schools are normalising it:\n\n- Presenting pornographic content as *inevitable* — rather than challenging its harm.\n\n- Telling children that **all sexual desires are valid** — without giving them the tools to understand abuse, coercion, or consent properly.\n\n- Teaching complex adult concepts about **gender, sexuality, and identity** without ensuring that children understand their own bodies, safety, and boundaries first.\n\n**The result:** a generation that knows every label and every kink — but can’t spot grooming when it happens.\n\n---\n\n## Where Are the Safeguards?\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000427061f9b563d75bafb204c44048290309312962924.png?w=1024)\n\nThe Department for Education claims there is guidance in place.\nBut here’s the truth:\n\n- There is **no national curriculum** for RSE — just guidelines.\n\n- Materials are often delivered by **unregulated third parties.**\n\n- Parents are **routinely denied full access** to preview content.\n\n- Schools fear legal challenges or public backlash if they object to activist-driven content — so they comply.\n\n**In this vacuum, extreme content has crept in — and most parents are none the wiser.**\n\n---\n\n## Real-World Cases\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_000000009bac61f9af2149927ae361935521185294946886201.png?w=1024)\n\n**In 2023, a primary school in London faced backlash after showing Year 4 children materials that included descriptions of masturbation and sexual acts.**\n**In 2024, a group of Welsh parents discovered their children had been taught about “safe choking” and “bondage” as part of a Year 9 relationships lesson.**\n**In 2025, a national audit revealed that many RSE resources used in UK classrooms had not been vetted by educational psychologists or child safeguarding experts.**\n\n**This is not education. This is indoctrination — and it is grooming children to view sexualisation as normal and desirable.**\n\n---\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nBecause if children are: \n\n**Exposed to sexualised media.**\n**Drawn into pornified mindsets.**\n**Then taught in class that all of    this is just “being open-minded” or “progressive” —**\n\n**You have the perfect storm.**\n\n**You create a generation that is less likely to report grooming.**\n**Less likely to recognise exploitation.**\n**Less likely to have any sense of where healthy boundaries truly lie.**\n\n**And the predators know it.**\n**And the profiteers know it.**\n\n---\n\n## What Should We Be Teaching?\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000a6f461f9ad193ceb84ccfb2a6127772207732115914.png?w=1024)\n\nHere’s what children really need:\n\n- **Early, age-appropriate education about bodily autonomy, privacy, and boundaries.**\n\n- **Clear understanding of what healthy relationships look like — based on respect and consent.**\n\n- **Honest conversations about the dangers of porn and online exploitation.**\n\n- **Critical thinking — so they can see through grooming tactics.**\n\n- **Tools to say NO and to recognise abuse.**\n\n**Not graphic sex tips. Not kink content. Not porn promotion. Not ideology.**\n\n---\n\n### If a stranger on the street told your 8-year-old about sex acts, you’d call the police.\nIf it happens in a classroom, we’re told to celebrate it.\n\n**We are gaslighting an entire generation.

Not just pop-ups — we’re talking full videos, entire categories, and repeat consumption. The days of “accidental clicks” are long gone. Many kids are now *actively searching* for it, or being shown it by peers.\n\nThe internet didn’t just make porn accessible — it made it **inescapable**. Social media, ads, games, dodgy links, even so-called “sex ed influencers” are walking kids straight into a pornified view of the world.\n\nAnd this early exposure? It isn’t neutral. It *shapes* them.\n\n---\n\n## Porn Is Raising A Generation — And It's Not Teaching Love\n\nPorn doesn’t teach connection. It teaches performance. It teaches domination. It teaches pain as pleasure and silence as consent.\n\nKids aren’t just watching it — they’re absorbing it. Mimicking it. Forming their first ideas about bodies, boundaries, pleasure, gender roles, and power through *scripted abuse marketed as desire.*\n\nAnd what’s worse? It’s **mainstream** now.\n\n---\n\n## Normalised Depravity: “Barely Legal” and the Rise of Incest Porn\n\nThe industry knows exactly what it’s doing.\n\n\"**Barely legal**\" isn’t a random title — it’s targeted fantasy. Make her look 16. Give her braces. Put her in a school uniform. Say she’s “nervous” or “inexperienced.” What does that teach boys? What does that teach girls?\n\nEven more disturbing: the surge of **incest-themed porn** — “stepbrother,” “daddy’s girl,” “family secrets.” It’s everywhere. And kids aren’t skipping it — they’re being algorithmically pushed towards it.\n\nThis isn’t just degrading — it’s dangerous. It builds **tolerance to taboo**, desensitisation to abuse, and normalises the breakdown of the most sacred human boundaries.\n\n---\n\n## The Algorithm Pushes the Worst Content\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_000000005dc0624394fab934295a8e8f3384277580089702261.png?w=1024)\n\nNot only is porn widely accessible — but platforms are *rewarding the most extreme content.*\n\nKids might start with curiosity — but quickly, they’re being served:\n\n- Aggressive porn\n\n- Humiliation themes\n\n- Degrading language\n\n- Taboo categories\n\n— all through algorithmic suggestion.\n\nThis isn’t freedom of choice — it’s corporate-driven *grooming*. Designed to addict. Designed to escalate. Designed to **erode empathy**.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: kids today often believe this is how sex is *supposed to be.*\n\n---\n\n## The Psychological Impact on Young Minds\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_000000009e7c624693f0dc02bd544c227758522157086781802.png?w=1024)\n\nThe fallout is immense — and growing.\n\nStudies show early and repeated porn exposure is linked to:\n\n- **Addiction-like patterns** in adolescent brains\n\n- **Desensitisation** to real intimacy\n\n- **Anxiety, depression, and shame** linked to unrealistic sexual expectations\n\n- **Higher tolerance for aggression** in relationships\n\n- **Body image issues** and self-objectification\n\n- **Confusion around consent** and boundaries\n\nAsk any school nurse, therapist, or safeguarding lead:\n**kids are mimicking porn, long before they understand themselves.**\n\n---\n\n## The Real-World Fallout\n\nBy the time they hit puberty, many kids have already:\n\n- Formed unrealistic and harmful expectations of sex.\n\n- Developed compulsive viewing habits and secrecy.\n\n- Struggled with intimacy, boundaries, and shame.\n\n- Witnessed violence masquerading as love.\n\nIt’s showing up everywhere:\nIn sexting.\nIn school-based sexual assault cases.\nIn increasing reports of children harming other children.\nIn a growing mental health crisis linked to shame, addiction, and trauma.\n\n---\n\n## Where’s the Line?\n\nThe truth? There *isn’t one anymore.*\nPorn sites don’t verify age properly.\nSearch engines don’t filter effectively.\nAnd parents? Many don’t even know what’s happening until it’s far too late.\n\nThe porn industry is worth billions. It thrives on addiction, taboo, and blurred boundaries. And when children are the collateral, it shrugs — and profits.\n\n---\n\n## So What Do We Do?\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000bccc6243a6f6881c5b98d8896056719252610865030.png?w=1024)\n\n- We **talk** — openly, honestly, *early*.\n\n- We **teach real consent** and compassion before the internet does.\n\n- We **challenge** the industry’s influence — as parents, teachers, activists, and humans.\n\n- We **protect** kids not just from predators — but from *systems* designed to groom their minds.\n\n---\n\nPart 3 will break down **how this filters into schools, PSHE lessons, and “progressive” education policies** — and how even classrooms are being caught in the crossfire between safeguarding and social engineering.\n\nBut for now, we leave you with this:\n\n> \n> If porn is shaping our kids’ worldview…\n> what kind of world are we raising them into?\n> \n> \n> \n\n---","src/content/articles/stolen-innocence-how-society-sexualises-our-children-2.md","a779f6633d1fdf43",{"html":4130,"metadata":4131},"\u003Cp>By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000c4846243a1d26c567f46a8324120368598204439948.png?w=683\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"part-2-pornified-minds--what-kids-are-really-being-exposed-to\">\u003Cstrong>PART 2: Pornified Minds — What Kids Are Really Being Exposed To\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>“We didn’t teach them this.”\u003C/em>\n\u003Cem>No — but porn did.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>They say childhood is sacred.\nBut what happens when a child’s first understanding of sex, love, consent, and bodies comes not from a parent or school — but from a porn site?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s not rare.

Not in the mess. Everyone's quick to talk about transformation, the high, the moment you see clearly, the trip, the tears, the scream that finally leaves your chest. But then what?\n\nWhat about the days after the collapse? The stillness after the storm?

But that’s not how it was for me.\n\nI came back from the void unsure how to exist. I didn’t want to go back to how I was living, but I didn’t know how to live differently.

You’re not high anymore. You're not protected by the experience. You’re raw. Thin-skinned. And the world doesn’t slow down for your healing.\n\n---\n\n## Spiritual Grief\n\nAfter certain trips, I didn’t just cry, I *grieved*. Deeply. For the person I was. For the pain I carried. For the years I lost not knowing why I hurt. There’s a grief that comes with awareness, especially when it’s sudden. It’s like losing a part of yourself that held you together, even if it was dysfunctional.\n\nI missed the numbing. I missed the oblivion. Because this clarity? It *burns*.\n\nI started questioning everything.\n\nWhy do I tolerate what I do? Why was I okay with being silenced? Why did I think love was pain? Why did I shrink myself just to feel safe?\n\nAnd the scariest one: *Who am I without my wounds?*\n\n---\n\n## The Isolation of Awakening\n\nNo one prepares you for how lonely it gets.\n\nWhen you start facing your shadow, not everyone claps. Some people pull away. Some mock it. Some get defensive, especially if your growth shines a light on their stagnation. Old friends don’t recognise you.

And small talk doesn’t hit the same when you’re unravelling at the soul level.\n\n---\n\n## When Feeling Better Feels Wrong\n\nThis part shocked me the most.\n\nAfter enough time, something strange happened, I started to feel… okay. Not fixed. Not euphoric. But *calm*. Clear. Capable.\n\nAnd that scared me.\n\nBecause for so long, chaos was home. Sadness was familiar. Anger was armour. Healing meant letting go of identities I’d worn like skin. It meant allowing peace, even when it felt unfamiliar.\n\nSometimes, we sabotage ourselves not because we don’t want to be better… but because we don’t know who we are without the suffering.\n\nI had to teach myself how to *receive ease*. How to let good things in without flinching. How to accept love without looking for the exit wound.\n\n---\n\n## Rebuilding in the Real World\n\nHere’s the unsexy truth of it: Healing also means laundry. Rest. Food. Saying no. Unfollowing people. Going to bed early. Sitting in boredom without chasing dopamine. Learning your patterns and stopping halfway through.\n\nIt means being *present*, even when the present aches.\n\nIt means letting people go who don’t match your nervous system anymore.\n\nIt means noticing when you’re about to lie to yourself and choosing not to.\n\nIt means saying: I survived that. Now how do I want to live?\n\nAnd it’s slow. Some days you’ll spiral. Some days you’ll laugh. Some days you’ll feel both in the same breath.\n\nBut that’s the aftershock. That’s where the true becoming begins.\n\n---\n\n## You don’t need to glow. You don’t need to post. You don’t need to “prove” your healing to anyone.\n\nYou just need to *keep showing up for yourself*. Even when it’s quiet. Even when it’s weird.

But parenting **without a blueprint** is a different level of pressure.\n\nMany survivor-parents:\n\n- Worry they’re emotionally unavailable\n\n- Fear they’re too intense\n\n- Struggle with touch, trust, or even basic play\n\n- Feel alienated from other parents who didn’t live what they lived\n\nAnd yet, they’re constantly told to “just move on” or “focus on the kids.”\n\nBut healing doesn’t stop when parenting begins.\nIn fact, for many survivors, parenthood re-opens wounds they thought were long closed.\n\n---\n\n## When Triggers Show Up in Your Child\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000041b06246bd0d7094509a21d29027672640086568199.png?w=683)\n\nOne of the most terrifying experiences for a survivor-parent is seeing something in your child that feels *too familiar*:\n\n- A child suddenly afraid to go somewhere\n\n- Bedwetting that starts out of nowhere\n\n- Secretive behaviour\n\n- A child saying something that sounds “off” but you can’t explain why\n\nThe mind spirals.\nIs it happening again?\nAm I being paranoid?\nWill people think I’m crazy?\nDo I say something — or risk being wrong?\n\nThis is where survivors often feel most alone.\n\nBecause they’re not only questioning the world — they’re questioning themselves.\n\n---\n\n## Support Is Prevention\n\nHere’s the truth society still hasn’t fully grasped:\n\n**Supporting survivor-parents is a form of child protection.**\n\nWhen survivors are:\n\n- Heard\n\n- Validated\n\n- Given tools and language\n\n- Surrounded by non-judgemental support\n\nThey’re more able to parent from a place of healing — not fear.\nMore able to break generational cycles instead of just surviving them.\n\nIt’s not about being perfect.\nIt’s about being supported — so your past doesn’t have to dictate your child’s future.\n\n---\n\n## What Survivor-Parents Need\n\nThey don’t need judgement. Or silence.

It’s packaged, promoted, and paraded in plain sight. Scroll TikTok for 30 seconds. Walk down the kids’ clothing aisle. Turn on a “family” Netflix show. It's everywhere — and it’s deliberate.\n\nWe’ve normalised what once would’ve triggered outrage. Mini crop tops with slogans like “Heartbreaker” in 5-year-old sizes. Dance challenges where preteens mimic hypersexual moves. YouTube stars under 12 being styled like reality TV influencers. And the views? Millions. Many of them from adult men. No one asks why.\n\nThis isn’t about being prudish. This is about power, grooming, and profit. Children are being moulded into adult-shaped fantasies — not by mistake, but by design. Their innocence is being sold back to us in algorithm-friendly packaging.\n\n---\n\n## The Hypersexual Culture Feed\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000d1646243af64f46345eca4b84383868421289381902.png?w=683)\n\nPlatforms like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube — these aren't neutral spaces. Their algorithms favour engagement. And guess what drives engagement when a child is involved? Sex appeal. If an 11-year-old in shorts and lip gloss gets more views than one in school uniform reading a book, guess which one the machine promotes?\n\nWe’ve seen young girls being praised as “baddies,” “slay queens,” “wife material” — all by adults. Comment sections are cesspits of innuendo, emojis, and thinly veiled paedophilia. And still, no age locks, no flags, no bans.\n\nThe truth is: tech doesn’t care who watches your child, as long as they’re watching.\n\n---\n\n## Kids’ Fashion or Fetishwear?\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000de6c61f49391291718f1baa7745517495894111711.png?w=1024)\n\nMajor high street brands are complicit. Children’s clothing lines now mimic adult styles — think tiny padded bras, off-the-shoulder tops, mesh panels, hot pants. Why? Because “influencer culture” sells — and even kids aren’t spared.\n\nGirls as young as 4 are being marketed lip gloss, fake nails, and “shimmer sticks.” Boys are told to be ‘players,’ dress like drill rappers, or act tough for validation.

While exposure teams and advocacy groups work tirelessly to **bring offenders to light**, the **lack of a centralised, accessible database** of cases and offenders **leaves parents, communities, and authorities struggling to grasp the full scale of the problem.**\n\nUnlike other crime categories, CSA records are often **hidden behind bureaucracy, inaccessible to the public, and poorly maintained** in terms of real-time updates. In a digital age where offenders **exploit technology to prey on children**, why is there **no comprehensive system in place** to track and prevent these crimes?\n\n---\n\n## **The Lack of Publicly Accessible Data**\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in tackling CSA in Wales is **the absence of an open database** where the public can access vital information about offenders, trends, and conviction rates.\n\n🔹 **No public offender map** – Unlike some countries where **sex offender registries** are partially accessible, Wales has **no public access to data about convicted predators.**\n\n🔹 **No central database of CSA-related arrests or cases** – The public is forced to **rely on sporadic media reports or exposure teams** to hear about recent cases.\n\n🔹 **Sarah’s Law has limitations** – The Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme (**Sarah’s Law**) allows **limited access to information**, but only under **strict conditions** and does not provide **full transparency.**\n\nWithout an accessible system, **parents, schools, and communities** are left unaware of potential risks in their own areas.\n\n---\n\n## **The Police and Legal System’s Failures**\n\nDespite thousands of CSA-related crimes being recorded each year, **there is no single authority responsible for tracking and reporting these cases in Wales.**\n\n📌 **Rising CSA Image Crimes** – Police in England and Wales are now recording **over 100 child sexual abuse image crimes every day**, with **38,685 incidents reported in the past year.** ([NSPCC](https://www.nspcc.org.uk))\n\n📌 **Registered Sex Offenders** – As of March 2024, there were **70,052 registered sex offenders** in England and Wales—**a 3% increase from the previous year.** ([Yahoo News UK](https://uk.news.yahoo.com))\n\n📌 **Teenage Offenders** – Over **half of CSA cases in the UK involve teenagers**, with **14 being the most common age of reported offenders.** ([ITV News](https://www.itv.com/news))\n\n**The real question remains: How many offenders are slipping through the cracks? How many children are unprotected due to the lack of open data sharing by law enforcement?**\n\n---\n\n## **Why Are Exposure Teams Filling the Gap?**\n\nThe **failures of law enforcement and lack of accessible databases** have led to the rise of **independent exposure teams.** These groups **fill the gaps**, tracking online predators, exposing offenders, and pushing for accountability.\n\n🚨 **Proactive Investigations** – **Exposure Teams** often **catch predators before police even begin investigations.**\n\n🚨 **Public Awareness** – Exposure teams **share case updates publicly**, ensuring that communities **know about local offenders before they can reoffend.**\n\n🚨 **Forcing Action** – Without these teams, **many predators would go unchecked**, as **police often delay action until overwhelming public pressure forces their hand.**\n\nHowever, **exposure teams are not a replacement for a functioning justice system.** The fact that **volunteer groups are doing this work** should be a **wake-up call** to how broken the system is.\n\n---\n\n## **What Needs to Change?**\n\nTo **properly combat CSA**, Wales must implement **urgent reforms**:\n\n✔ **A centralised, publicly accessible CSA case database** – Wales needs **real-time data** on investigations, arrests, and convictions to **track trends and prevent repeat offending.**\n\n✔ **Stronger digital tracking of online predators** – Many grooming cases happen **entirely online**, yet **police cybercrime resources remain limited.**\n\n✔ **More transparency in police data sharing** – **Parents and communities deserve access to critical safety information** rather than relying on exposure teams.\n\n✔ **Better resources for CSA survivors** – Many survivors in Wales **struggle to access legal support, mental health care, and protection from their abusers.**\n\n---\n\n## **The Cost of Silence**\n\nWales has **a serious and urgent problem** when it comes to **CSA tracking and offender accountability.** While exposure teams continue to **fill the gaps**, the reality is **this should not be their job.**\n\n**Until law enforcement and government agencies prioritise full transparency, create an accessible offender database, and improve CSA case tracking, children in Wales will remain at risk.**\n\n**Silence allows predators to operate unchecked.

It’s a Blueprint.**\n\nThey’ll tell you this is about failure.\nThat the system “missed the signs.”\nThat no one could’ve known what was really going on.\n\nBut they did.\nThey knew.\n\nThis isn’t failure. This is function.\nThis is how it was built.\n\nWe were surrounded by predators—and the people meant to protect us were trained to protect them.\n\nWhy?\nBecause predators wear uniforms.\nThey sign paychecks. They run schools. They coach teams. They sit in Parliament.\n\nAnd if you believe victims, you have to look at who those predators really are.\n\nSo instead, they turn the other way.\nThey bury reports.\nThey discredit victims.\nThey paint predators as respectable—and us as unreliable.\n\nThey didn’t just ignore us.\n**They manufactured doubt around us.**\n\nThey created a system where:\n\n- Reputation outweighs evidence\n\n- Silence is rewarded\n\n- Whistleblowers are punished\n\n- Victims are disbelieved by default\n\nThis isn’t about a few missed cases.\n**This is about a system designed to maintain power, no matter how many girls it destroys.**\n\n---\n\n### **They Watched Us Fall — And Chose Not to Catch Us**\n\nWe weren’t invisible.\nWe were everywhere—on their registers, in their care, under their supervision.\nWe were the girls they labelled before they listened.\n\nSome of us were neurodivergent.\nSome were traumatised.\nSome were just loud, messy, unpredictable.\n\nMany of us came from council estates, broken homes, or places the world already gave up on.\nWe didn’t fit their version of what a “real” victim looks like.\n\nSo when the signs started showing—\nWhen we started disappearing into ourselves, into strange men’s cars, into chaos—\nThey didn’t step in.\n**They stepped back.**\n\n---\n\nWe were “too grown.”\n“Too difficult.”\n“Too sexual.”\n**They blamed us for what was happening to us.**\n\nThey knew.\n\nThey knew when the shopkeeper touched one of us and we gave full statements—and nothing happened.\nThey knew when teachers dismissed reports of the bus driver.\nThey knew when we told adults about the man who watched us from the trees—only for him to assault a girl years later.\n\nThey knew, and still they let us fall.\n\n---\n\nAnd when we didn’t act like victims?\nWhen we were angry?\nWhen we were numb?\nWhen we tried to laugh through the fear, flirt through the shame, survive through the silence?\n\nThey called us liars.\nDrama queens.\n“Too much.”\n“Attention-seekers.”\n\n---\n\nThey were never protecting us.\n**They were protecting themselves.**\n\nBecause if they admitted we were right, they’d have to admit they failed us.\nIf they looked closely, they’d have to see just how many of us there were.\n\nSo they looked away.\nAnd we were left to carry the weight.\n\nWe didn’t fall through the cracks.\nWe were pushed into them.\n\n---\n\n### **The Institutional Web: Where Every Door Closes**\n\nWe weren’t failed by one person.\nWe weren’t failed once.\n**We were failed in layers—by every system we were told to trust.**\n\nEach one had its own way of closing the door on us.\nEach one played its part in making sure we stayed silent.\n\nTogether?\n**They built a fortress that kept predators safe—and us trapped inside.**\n\n---\n\n**Schools**\nThey saw us every day.\nThey saw us disappear into ourselves, spiral, act out, shrink down.\nThey heard the whispers.\nThey *knew* who was waiting at the gates.\n\nBut they didn’t want to “get involved.”\nThey didn’t want the responsibility.\nSo instead, they blamed our behaviour.

I didn’t consent. I didn’t even *hint* at wanting to see it.\nAnd yet… there it was. Just *hanging out*. Uninvited. Unwelcome.

He’s behind a keyboard, sending out unsolicited nudes like he’s on some sort of genital PR tour.\nAnd worse — **some of them genuinely believe this is flirting**.\n\nLike babes, I don’t know who lied to you — but a surprise penis is not a love letter. It’s a *threat wrapped in pixels*.\n\nSending me a dick pic is not an introduction — it’s a red flag with a pulse. It’s your dating CV soaked in delusion.\n\n---\n\n## Introducing: The Dick Pic Invoice\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000e34461f7bc9be5ac0f17d0ab281296480500587696952261.jpg?w=1024)\n\nSince this seems to be the new normal, I’ve decided to adapt.\nBut not by tolerating it — **by monetising the trauma**.\n\nYou want to flash me through Messenger? Fine.\nHere’s your bill:\n\n**ServicePrice** \n\n- Emotional Damage Fee £250 \n\n- Eyeball Bleach (industrial grade) £14.99 \n\n- Emergency Therapy Session £75/hr \n\n- Digital Contamination Cleanup £49.99 \n\n- Public Roast Prep (limited time) FREE (but savage)\n\n- Spiritual Cleanse & Energy Reset £33.33 \n\nTOTAL £423.31\n\n**Invoices are sent by divine law and spiritual fury. Payment due immediately.**\nLate fees include being the main character in a viral takedown post.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Is Actually Serious (Under the Jokes)\n\nLet’s drop the sarcasm for a second — because this isn’t just banter. It’s not harmless, it’s not “just a bit of fun,” and it’s *definitely* not okay.\n\n**Sending unsolicited sexual images is harassment.**\nFull stop.\nIt’s degrading. It’s intrusive. It’s a digital violation of space and self.\n\nAnd the frequency of it? Alarming.\n\nWomen don’t talk about it as much anymore because it’s become so normalised, it’s just another Tuesday.\nBut let’s be honest — that normalisation? That silence? That’s how abuse wins.\n\n---\n\n## I'm Not Staying Quiet\n\nI’m done pretending it’s just annoying.\nIt’s disgusting. And I’m calling it out — publicly, loudly, and with enough sarcasm to rupture fragile egos across the UK.\n\nIf you send me a dick pic and I didn't ask for it?\n**You’re not sexy. You’re not brave. You’re a digital flasher in need of a reality check — and possibly therapy.**\n\nAnd no, you don’t get anonymity. You get my rage and a custom-built invoice. Consider this your one-time warning before you’re immortalised in a blog post titled “Why Your Cock Made Me Cringe So Hard I Pulled a Muscle.”\n\n---\n\n## TO THE WOMEN READING THIS\n\nYou’re not alone.\nYou’re not overreacting.\nYou’re not being dramatic.\n\nYour inbox is **your space**. Not a dropbox for desperate men’s genitals.\nYou have every right to report, block, rant, roast — or bill the bastard.\nDo whatever feels right.\n\nAnd if you *have* received unsolicited pics?\n**You’re part of a very tired, very pissed-off club.**\nPull up a chair. We’re making memes and printing invoices.\n\n---\n\n## TO THE SENDERS\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/messenger_creation_627b132c-e1ef-4f4e-89ed-dea8fbcd9e1c_edit_499175826409036867156678665849992.jpg?w=940)\n\nI don’t know what you think you’re doing.\nBut it’s not impressive.\nIt’s not bold.\nAnd it’s definitely not something that’ll get you laid.\n\nYou are not Casanova.\nYou are not God’s gift.\nYou are a walking cautionary tale with Wi-Fi.\n\n**Put it away. Zip it up. And get therapy.**\n\nBecause the next image that shows up uninvited?\nI’m saving it, skewering it, and framing it as *the moment masculinity lost the plot*.\n\n---\n\n## CALL TO ACTION! \n\n**Have you been flashed online?**\nTell your story. Post your invoice.\nLet’s make this a movement — because I’m done tiptoeing around digital dickheads.\n\nAnd lads — unless we ask, don’t send.\nBecause from now on, every unsolicited pic is getting taxed, roasted, and turned into content.\n\nYou send it, I bill it.\nWelcome to the age of Consequence.\n\n---","src/content/articles/the-digital-flasher-steven-blundell.md","5e2671ad4bab798a",{"html":4627,"metadata":4628},"\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"unsolicited-dick-pics-eyeball-assaults-and-why-im-now-charging-a-trauma-fee\">\u003Cstrong>Unsolicited Dick Pics, Eyeball Assaults, and Why I’m Now Charging a Trauma Fee\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/10000449261955029877251974227.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There’s something truly magical about waking up, sipping your morning tea, opening your inbox — and being visually assaulted by a complete stranger’s meat flute.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another day, another unsolicited dick pic.\nI didn’t ask.

Their work is often **live-streamed** for transparency, handing over evidence to police to push for legal action.\n\nBut despite their success, these teams face **challenges, criticism, and even personal risk.** This article takes an in-depth look at **who they are, how they operate, and the undeniable impact they’re making.**\n\n---\n\n## **How Sting Teams Work**\n\nThe **methods used by exposure teams** vary, but most follow a **structured process** designed to **catch predators red-handed** while remaining within legal boundaries.\n\n- **Decoy Operations** – Members pose as **underage children** on social media or messaging apps.\n\n- **Engagement & Evidence Gathering** – They **document conversations**, ensuring there is **clear intent** from the predator.\n\n- **The Sting** – A live or recorded **confrontation** occurs, often **broadcast on social media** for transparency.\n\n- **Police Involvement** – Teams **hand over all evidence** to law enforcement, pushing for an arrest and conviction.\n\nThese groups **do not entrap**—they simply **expose those already seeking to harm children.**\n\n---\n\n## **The Challenges of Exposure Work**\n\nDespite their **undeniable success**, sting teams face **constant obstacles**, including:\n\n- **Legal Pressure** – Authorities have accused some teams of **jeopardising investigations**, even when their evidence leads to convictions.\n\n- **Police Resistance** – Some forces **refuse to acknowledge** their work, despite teams handing over **solid evidence.**\n\n- **Personal Risk** – Team members are often **threatened, attacked, or harassed**, both online and in person.\n\n- **Social Media Bans** – Platforms like Facebook and TikTok **routinely remove accounts** that share exposure content.\n\nYet, despite these barriers, **they continue.**\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fb_img_17389725305417579062043505447822.jpg?w=960)\n\n## **Voices from the Frontline: Conversations with Predator Awareness**\n\nTo truly understand what drives these teams, I spoke with **Tom (The Founder) and Angel (A Team Membe**r**) **from Predator Awareness, two individuals who have dedicated themselves to **exposing predators and fighting for justice.**\n\n### **Q: What drives you to do this work?**\n\n**Angel:**\n*\"There comes a moment in life when you realise that if you don’t take a stand, no one will. Children are our future, yet the systems designed to protect them often fail them. We refuse to be silent. Every predator exposed, every victim saved, is a step towards a safer world.\"*\n\n*\"This is not just a mission, it’s a calling, a spiritual path. We walk this road knowing the risks, yet driven by an unshakable duty to those who have no voice. To protect the innocent is the highest form of justice, and we will not turn away.\"*\n\n**Tom:**\n*\"What drives me is seeing the failings, day in and day out, of a system that is failing our kids*, *police officers turning a blind eye, social workers, councillors, and MPs doing nothing.\"*\n\n*\"Then you see the devastating effects these perpetrators leave on victims. It’s mental torture for them. The victims are the ones serving the life sentence. And some don’t even see justice or get any kind of closure for what happened to them.\"*\n\n*\"If only the authorities walked in a victim’s shoes for a day, they would understand.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Q: What’s the biggest challenge teams face?**\n\n**Angel:**\n*\"Our biggest challenge isn’t just exposing predators, it’s surviving the backlash. The system, the police, and institutions that should be on our side often work against us. We are watched, harassed, threatened, and silenced through legal loopholes, false accusations, and even gang-stalking.\"*\n\n*\"And yet, we press on. We refuse to let fear win. Because the price of silence is far greater than the price of speaking out. If we don’t fight for the children, who will?\"*\n\n**Tom:**\n*\"The biggest challenge is avoiding being silenced by the authorities we are set to expose. We all know the risks of doing this kind of work, but that risk is worth it every single time.\"*\n\n*\"The damage is done for us and our generation, but we have the power today to rewrite the future. And we have to fight for our kids’ safety. We have to fight for justice.\"*\n\n*\"The truth is, the courts and police only like to hear the truth when it suits them.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Q: How do you feel exposure teams are making a difference?**\n\n**Angel:**\n*\"We are the alarm that cannot be ignored. Exposure teams force accountability where the system tries to look away. We bring hidden crimes to the surface, making sure the world sees what lurks in the shadows.\"*\n\n*\"Every story we expose sends a message: You will not prey on children without consequences. We show that no one is untouchable, even if the system tries to protect the perpetrators.\"*\n\n*\"The walls of silence are cracking, and we are the force breaking them down.\"*\n\n**Tom:**\n*\"We make a difference by delivering the real truth—exposing their failings and doing what we know is right.\"*\n\n*\"We have to rewrite the future so that kids don’t have to suffer the way we have suffered. We risk losing our freedom to do it, but what is freedom compared to a child’s safety? It doesn’t even come close.\"*\n\n*\"I would give up my freedom every single time if it meant every child in this country would be safe.\"*\n\n---\n\n## **Do Sting Teams Really Make a Difference?**\n\nDespite the **controversies and risks**, exposure teams have led to **hundreds of arrests and convictions.** Some of the most **notorious UK predators** have been caught through sting operations, including:\n\n- **Lewis Edwards (Bridgend)** – Groomed over **200 underage girls** online before his arrest.\n\n- **Paul Cavanagh (Liverpool)** – A repeat offender caught **twice** by different sting teams.\n\n- **Dozens of high-profile arrests** where exposure teams handed over solid evidence.\n\nIn many cases, **police had not even been investigating the suspects**, proving that these teams **fill a gap that cannot be ignored.**\n\n---\n\n## **The Future of UK Exposure Teams**\n\nThe question remains—**will these teams always be necessary?**\n\nMany advocates believe that **if police took online grooming more seriously**, exposure teams would not need to exist. But until there are **tougher laws, faster police action, and better child protection policies**, sting teams will continue their work.\n\nDespite the risks, **they refuse to be silenced.**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts: A Necessary Force for Change**\n\n**Like them or not, UK exposure teams are making an undeniable impact.** They are:\n\n- **Forcing the justice system to take notice.**\n\n- **Educating the public on online dangers.**\n\n- **Holding predators accountable where others fail.**\n\nAnd most importantly?\n\nThey are making sure **that no child goes unprotected, even when the system looks away.**\n\n---\n\n### **Resources & Reporting CSA**\n\nIf you suspect CSA or need support, **contact the following organisations:**\n\n- **NSPCC:** 0808 800 5000 | [www.nspcc.org.uk](https://www.nspcc.org.uk)\n\n- **NAPAC (Adult Survivors of CSA):** 0808 801 0331 | [www.napac.org.uk](https://www.napac.org.uk)\n\n- **Childline (Under 18s):** 0800 1111 | [www.childline.org.uk](https://www.childline.org.uk)\n\n- **CEOP (Online CSA Reporting):** [www.ceop.police.uk](https://www.ceop.police.uk)\n\n---","src/content/articles/the-frontline-against-predators-how-uk-sting-teams-are-fighting-for-justice.md","2982e93a4257e603",{"html":4674,"metadata":4675},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/file-y5jzpg1sbyxeadtsnww8ns3321239097146799493.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"️-by-sophie-lewis-independent-writer\">©️ \u003Cem>By\u003C/em>* Sophie Lewis, Inde*pendent Writer\u003C/h4>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-growing-movement-for-child-protection\">\u003Cstrong>A Growing Movement for Child Protection\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Across the UK, \u003Cstrong>sting teams and awareness groups\u003C/strong> have taken on a role that many believe \u003Cstrong>should already be covered by law enforcement\u003C/strong>—exposing online predators before they can harm children.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These independent teams, made up of \u003Cstrong>ordinary people with extraordinary determination\u003C/strong>, pose as underage decoys to catch offenders attempting to groom children.

For all of us who didn’t have one. And I want to build it with *you*.\n\nNot as an expert. As a mirror.\n\n---\n\n## The Dream: A Healing Collective\n\nEventually? Retreats. Not the luxury kind. The *real* kind.\n\nGrounded. Raw. Intimate. Run by survivors, for survivors.\n\nCircles instead of hierarchies. Shared grief. Shared fire. Shared truth.\n\nWe heal in community. We rise in collective. We build what they never gave us.\n\n---\n\n## You’re Not Alone — You’re Early\n\nYou weren’t broken. You were just ahead. Too awake. Too raw. Too much.\n\nAnd now?

The piece analysed how unregulated “paedophile hunter” groups often deploy intimidation tactics, operate without professional oversight, and prioritise performance over child protection.\n\nWithin hours, one of the subjects contacted me. Six days later, he proved my thesis by enacting every intimidation tactic I’d just documented.\n\nI didn’t report it to police. I documented it for publication. Because this isn’t about me, it’s about the pattern.\n\n---\n\n## The Original Investigation\n\nMy article,* *[“When Protectors Mirror Predators: The Structural Failures of Vigilante Sting Operations,”](https://thegroomingfiles.com/2025/07/07/the-predator-paradox-when-exposure-becomes-the-behaviour/) examined how some hunter groups use methods that mirror predator behaviour: grooming trust, exploiting vulnerabilities, and operating in accountability-free spaces. The piece focused on documented cases, including the 2015 death of Darren Kelly following online vigilante accusations, and analysed how these operations can cause serious harm whilst claiming to protect children.\n\nOne case I covered was Sam Miller’s 2023 conviction at Newcastle Crown Court for false imprisonment. During a 14-minute Facebook livestream, Miller detained an innocent man who was subsequently held by police for 17 hours before being released without charge. Judge Clemitson described Miller as having an “unhealthy obsession” with sex offenders and an “inflated sense of his own importance,” noting the group appeared focused on “Facebook likes” rather than genuine safeguarding.\n\nEvery detail about Miller’s conviction in my article was verified against court records, Judge Clemitson’s sentencing remarks, and Northumbria Police statements. This is standard journalistic practice. What happened next was not.\n\n---\n\n## The Six-Day Gap\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image_editor_output_image320143292-17673509049987445346344152192902.png?w=782)\n\nOn 26 December at 22:02, Miller (who uses the name Sam Allan on Facebook) sent me a friendly-seeming message: *“Would be good to get your story straight 😊.”* He attempted a phone call at 22:23, which I missed. Then: silence.\n\nFor six days, nothing. No follow-up, no further contact. Then, on 1 January at 17:25, a voice message arrived. The tone had changed completely.\n\n---\n\n## The 8pm Ultimatum\n\n> \n> “Sophie, I haven’t checked yet. Obviously I’ve been busy over the Christmas time. I’m guessing that you’ve changed, amended or deleted the article and taken my name out of there. Obviously if you haven’t then I’m going to have to reply. Bearing in mind when I reply it’s not going to be nice.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nHe continued:\n\n> \n> “In my view you’re basically sticking up for paedophiles and seeing they’ve been wronged when they haven’t. I’ve got a page which basically gets 11 million views every month and I’ve got a quarter of a million followers. You’ve got 5,000. So it doesn’t take a brain surgeon to work out who’s going to get the most coverage.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nThe message ended with a deadline:\n\n> \n> “If I check later on and obviously there’s incorrect information in there then I’ll have to post it to set the record straight. So it’s your call. Just let us know. You’ve got till I’ll give you 8 o’clock.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nThere it was: platform leverage, follower-count intimidation, a ticking clock, and the familiar vigilante smear, questioning their methods framed as “sticking up for paedophiles”.\n\n---\n\n## The Escalation\n\nAt 19:08, I responded professionally, establishing my credentials and the factual basis of my reporting. I stated clearly:\n\n> \n> “I’m an NUJ-accredited investigative journalist. Every detail about your false imprisonment conviction in my article is verified against court records, Judge Clemitson’s sentencing remarks, and Northumbria Police statements. Your threat to use your 250k followers against me for publishing factual journalism, complete with an 8pm deadline, is precisely the intimidation pattern the article examines. This conversation is fully documented. The article stands.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nWhat followed was a rapid escalation.\n\n**19:30** — Personal attacks began:\n“You a recovering smackhead?” followed by appearance-based harassment and concern-trolling about my mental health.\n\n**19:39** — Threats escalated:\n“I’ve got your ex partner in my inbox now revealing all.”\n“Not going to end well.”\nHe claimed he would spread the campaign across “5 other pages and TikTok and Insta”.\n\n**20:26 onwards** — Direct intimidation:\n“I have your address which I could also legally post. Shall we go there? I dont mind.”\n\nWhen I called this a threat, he replied:\n\n> \n> “How’s that a threat? Its public accessible information which I’m saying I can share.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n**20:47** — Credibility attacks:\n“Just checked you arent a registered journalist ahahaha. Its clearly expired. Because there’s nothing active in your name.”\n\nThis was false. My NUJ accreditation is current and verifiable.\n\n**21:46** — He revealed he was messaging others in my professional network, attempting to damage my reputation across multiple platforms.\n\n---\n\n## The Public Smear\n\nThat same evening, Miller published a post on his Child Online Safety Team (COST) page titled *“Sophie lewis – self styled reporter.”* The post claimed I “repeatedly published articles criticising paedophile-hunting groups,” that my work contained information that was “neither factually accurate nor properly verified,” and concluded:\n\n> \n> “Our concern is, why would someone go out of the way to defend those who abuse kids.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nEvery claim was false. But that is precisely the function of such smears: once the accusation of “defending paedophiles” is made publicly, reputational damage occurs regardless of truth.\n\nMiller has since deleted this post.\n\n---\n\n## The Documentation\n\nAs a journalist who had just spent weeks researching intimidation tactics, I recognised what was happening in real time. So I did what journalists do: I documented it.\n\nOn 1 January, I published a comprehensive breakdown on a safeguarding platform where I had served as an administrator for 18 months. The post included timestamped screenshots, the voice message recording, analysis of Miller’s tactical progression, and court record citations. I titled it to reflect the same intimidation patterns analysed in my original article.\n\nThe post was evidence-based, factual, and meticulously sourced. It was also, apparently, too much truth for institutional comfort.\n\n---\n\n## The Choice\n\nShortly after publishing my documentation, I was asked to remove it. The reason given: to “keep the peace”.\n\nLet that sink in. After 18 months of contributing to a safeguarding platform, I was asked to delete a timestamped, screenshot-evidenced account of journalist intimidation, not because it was inaccurate, but because it might cause conflict.\n\nI faced a choice: remove documentation of harassment to preserve organisational relationships, or maintain journalistic integrity and walk away.\n\nWhen keeping the peace means silencing accountability, the institution has already chosen a side.\n\nI chose journalism. I walked on New Year’s Day.\n\n---\n\n## What This Reveals\n\nMiller’s response aligned closely with the structural concerns raised in my original article. The tactics used, platform leverage, deadline pressure, personal attacks, credibility challenges, the “defending paedophiles” smear, multi-platform harassment, and threats framed as public information sharing are not unique to one individual. They are patterns that emerge when groups operate without professional oversight or accountability frameworks.\n\nBut the institutional response reveals something equally troubling: how organisations that claim to prioritise safeguarding can prioritise comfort over truth when confronted with documented evidence of intimidation.\n\nThis is not unique to one platform. It reflects a broader pattern across safeguarding spaces where questioning methods is reframed as attacking the mission; where accountability is treated as betrayal; and where institutions choose appeasement over evidence.\n\nThe chilling effect is real. When journalists face coordinated harassment for reporting documented facts, and when organisations ask them to delete evidence rather than stand behind verified material, accountability journalism becomes unsustainable.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nI’m not writing this for sympathy or protection. I’m writing it because the pattern matters.\n\nVigilante groups claim to protect children. Some genuinely do important work within appropriate boundaries. But when criticism of methods triggers intimidation campaigns, when factual reporting is met with smear tactics, and when institutions retreat rather than defend truth, the focus shifts from protection to power.\n\nThe irony is striking: I wrote about how some vigilante operations replicate coercive dynamics. The response mirrored those dynamics. I documented how critics are pressured. The documentation itself became the target.\n\nMiller gave me a deadline. I gave him evidence. He wanted silence. He got a case study.\n\n---\n\n## The Work Continues\n\nEvery message Miller sent is now part of the record. Every tactic he used has been documented and analysed. The institutional response has been noted and will inform future reporting on how safeguarding organisations handle accountability challenges.\n\nThis is what accountability journalism looks like: evidence-based, meticulous, and unwilling to be silenced by intimidation or institutional pressure.\n\nTo other journalists covering vigilante operations: document everything, verify twice, and don’t back down when the backlash comes. Your accreditation matters. Your sources matter. Your integrity matters more than any organisation’s comfort.\n\nTo survivors and advocates: watch who responds to scrutiny with evidence and who responds with intimidation. That difference matters.\n\nAnd to those who believe questioning tactics means defending abusers: genuine child protection does not require silencing journalists. Accountability strengthens safeguarding. Transparency builds trust. Intimidation reveals weakness.\n\nThe article Miller tried to silence remains published. This one joins it.\n\n**The work continues.**\n\n---\n\n***Sophie Lewis**** is an NUJ-accredited investigative journalist specialising in institutional safeguarding failures and predator behaviour patterns.

The piece analysed how unregulated “paedophile hunter” groups often deploy intimidation tactics, operate without professional oversight, and prioritise performance over child protection.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Within hours, one of the subjects contacted me. Six days later, he proved my thesis by enacting every intimidation tactic I’d just documented.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I didn’t report it to police. I documented it for publication.

The piece focused on documented cases, including the 2015 death of Darren Kelly following online vigilante accusations, and analysed how these operations can cause serious harm whilst claiming to protect children.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One case I covered was Sam Miller’s 2023 conviction at Newcastle Crown Court for false imprisonment. During a 14-minute Facebook livestream, Miller detained an innocent man who was subsequently held by police for 17 hours before being released without charge. Judge Clemitson described Miller as having an “unhealthy obsession” with sex offenders and an “inflated sense of his own importance,” noting the group appeared focused on “Facebook likes” rather than genuine safeguarding.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Every detail about Miller’s conviction in my article was verified against court records, Judge Clemitson’s sentencing remarks, and Northumbria Police statements.

This is **still happening** — quietly, routinely, and without justice.\n\n---\n\n## What the Law Says — and How It’s Ignored\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000016e46246ae24d3ed01463c8f_conversation_id3d6802dfc3-40c4-8002-87a2-7ee22facea6326message_id3dfee6c00f-6349-4ea2-a3a6-7c9da67e22b52986822170798098209.jpg?w=1024)\n\nIn both England and Wales, the law is clear: children under the age of 16 **cannot legally be placed** in unregistered care homes.\n\nIn England, the **Care Planning, Placement and Case Review Regulations** were updated in 2021 to reflect that. In Wales, it has long been a legal requirement for children's homes to be registered with **Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW)**. Unregistered settings are considered illegal — and unsafe.\n\nAnd yet, the practice continues.\n\nIn England, the **Children’s Commissioner** confirmed that councils placed hundreds of under-16s in unregulated settings between 2022 and 2023. Ofsted received reports of **845 illegal placements** that year — but **not one prosecution** followed.\n\nIn Wales, **92 services** were identified by CIW as operating without registration — some repeatedly used by councils, with staff lacking training or safeguarding protocols. One report revealed councils “knowingly breached the law” to secure emergency placements.\n\nThese are not technicalities. These are children being placed in danger — knowingly, and sometimes strategically — by the very systems designed to protect them.\n\n---\n\n## The Numbers They Hide\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000007db4620a8cf9e68c000f20ad584105143302979151.png?w=1024)\n\nOn paper, these are just numbers. In reality, they’re stories of harm — hidden behind spreadsheets and buried in annual reports.\n\n### England\n\nIn 2022–23:\n\n- **724 children under 1**6 were illegally placed in unregulated care settings\n\n- Over **£105 million** of public money was spent by English councils on these placements\n\n- Ofsted received **845 reports** of illegal care homes\n\n- **Zero providers** were prosecuted\n\nMany of these placements were made in so-called “semi-independent” settings — often with no carers present overnight, no formal inspections, and no therapeutic support. Some of the children placed were as young as 11. Several were on child protection plans. All were legally entitled to care. Few received any.\n\n### Wales\n\nIn the same year:\n\n- **92 unregistered settings** were discovered by Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW)\n\n- These included homes used repeatedly by councils, despite prior warnings\n\n- In multiple cases, premises were never designed to house children — including B&Bs and makeshift flats\n\n- CIW described these as “unlawful and unsuitable” — yet many remained open\n\nIn one case, a young girl with severe trauma was moved across three illegal homes in under four months. In another, a teenage boy was placed with rotating agency staff with no safeguarding checks in place. Local authorities cited “placement pressure” as justification — but CIW found some councils were **failing to even try** legal routes before turning to unregistered providers.\n\n### The Cost of Convenience\n\nAcross both countries, the trend is the same: public money flows into unregulated, often dangerous placements — with little to no transparency. On average:\n\n- These placements cost **£140,000–£160,000 per child per year**\n\n- That’s **more than double** what many registered homes charge\n\n- And far more than what councils would spend on early intervention or trauma-informed support\n\nYet year after year, this continues. Because it’s easier. Because it’s cheaper. Because, on paper, it ticks a box: “child placed.”\n\n---\n\n## Survivor Voices – What It Feels Like Inside\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000075e86246915476a939ffdfc83199405143607463886.png?w=683)\n\nBehind every statistic is a child who remembers.\n\nTheir names are hidden, but their stories aren’t.\n\n### “I was 14. I’d already been hurt at home. Then they put me in a house with no staff. Just a key and a rota.”\n\n*– Anonymous care leaver, England*\n\nShe had been removed from an abusive household. Then, with no registered placement available, her council placed her in a privately-run “semi-independent unit” — a converted flat with no permanent staff, just visiting agency workers. There were no school arrangements. No therapy. No routine.\n\nShe went missing within a week.\n\n---\n\n### “They moved me to a town I’d never heard of. I was 200 miles away. I didn’t know a soul.”\n\n*– Young person, unregistered home in South Wales*\n\nIn Wales, the issue is often invisible. One teenage boy with ADHD and PTSD was placed in three different unregistered homes in under six months. Each time, he was moved by taxi — with little notice. One property had broken locks. Another had no heating. In one, he shared the space with an older child who’d been in trouble with the police.\n\nHe told CIW inspectors he felt “dumped and forgotten.”\n\n---\n\n### “There was no one at night. Just me and the silence. If something happened, who would know?”\n\n*– Former resident, illegal home in the North West*\n\nThis is the silent core of the scandal: children left to parent themselves in the name of “independence.” No permanent adult presence. No regulated support. No one checking they’re even safe.\n\nInspectors found children cooking for themselves, managing medication, and living in settings described as “inappropriate and isolating.” One child in a 2023 review had been missing 13 times before a care plan was even updated.\n\nFor many, the trauma of unregulated care runs deeper than their original reason for entering the system. Because at least at home, they say, someone knew their name.\n\n---\n\n## Profiting from Pain – The Companies Cashing In\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000033c6243a4ac0adc419c29228864026927669119147.png?w=1024)\n\nWhile children are moved between unsafe placements and unregulated flats, someone’s balance sheet is booming.\n\nIn 2022–23, English councils paid **over £105 million** to private providers operating unregistered or semi-independent homes. In Wales, though profit-making in children’s care is now being phased out, the shadow of private contracts still looms large.\n\n### The Business of “Care”\n\nMany of the companies running these settings describe themselves as “specialist providers” of support. But inspections, reports, and whistleblower testimonies reveal a different picture: empty rooms, untrained staff, inflated fees — and no care at all.\n\nAmong the most frequently named are:\n\n- **Care 4 Children** – previously found operating homes without proper registration; faced serious concerns in Ofsted reports\n\n- **Keys Group** – one of the largest providers in the UK; previously ran homes with safeguarding failures but continued to win public contracts\n\n- **Calcot Services for Children** – received millions in council funding while homes were cited for inadequate standards\n\nThese companies don’t just run one or two homes. Some operate across **multiple local authorities**, taking on children hundreds of miles from their families. In several cases, one company ran three or more “homes” on the same street — placing highly vulnerable children side-by-side with little oversight.\n\n### The Profit Margin\n\nCouncils often pay between **£2,500 and £4,000 per week, per child** for these placements — even when they’re technically illegal.\n\nYet many staff in these homes earn close to minimum wage.\nSome receive **no specialist training** in trauma, safeguarding, or child development.\nSeveral inspections found **lone working practices** where a single worker was left responsible for multiple high-needs children overnight.\n\nThat profit doesn’t vanish. It goes to CEOs, shareholders, and in some cases, **private equity firms**. In 2021, a report by the **Children’s Commissioner** warned that the marketisation of children’s care was leading to “unacceptable financial risk and moral failure.” That warning was ignored.\n\nAnd so the cycle continues. Children pay the cost.\nCompanies collect the invoice.\n\n---\n\n## Ofsted’s Inaction and Political Silence\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000ccf06243a20dc8eb9d4497325821366405040497155.png?w=1024)\n\nWhen children are placed in dangerous settings, there’s one body meant to intervene.\n\nThat body is **Ofsted** in England — and **Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW)** across the border.\n\nBut despite hundreds of warnings, reports, and red flags, **neither regulator has used their full powers** to hold providers or councils accountable.\n\n### 845 Reports. Zero Prosecutions.\n\nIn 2022–23, Ofsted received **845 alerts** about children being placed in **illegal, unregistered homes**. It investigated. It warned. It advised.\n\nIt **prosecuted no one**.\n\nNot one private company was taken to court. Not one council was fined. Not one provider lost their ability to continue operating.\n\nWhy? Ofsted claimed a “supportive approach” was more productive — encouraging homes to seek registration rather than punishing breaches.\n\nBut as one whistleblower told *The Observer*:\n\n> \n> “It’s become a game. They’ll shut one home and open another across the road. Ofsted knows. Everyone knows. But nothing changes.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n### CIW: ‘Unlawful and Unsafe’ — But Still Operating\n\nIn Wales, CIW identified **92 unregistered services** operating during the same year — many of them repeatedly used by councils. In its own words, these homes were “**unlawful**” and “**unsuitable for children’s needs**.”\n\nYet even with that language, most were allowed to continue operating. No criminal action was taken. No emergency reforms were imposed.\n\nInstead, local authorities were simply advised to “reduce their reliance” on such placements — a soft phrase for an illegal practice.\n\n### Political Silence, Empty Promises\n\nIn Parliament, questions have been asked. Reports have been written. Pledges have been made.\n\nBut change has been slow, fragmented, and shallow.\n\nIn England:\n\n- The government promised “urgent reform” in 2021\n\n- Yet by 2023, **hundreds of under-16s** were still being placed in illegal settings\n\n- A national strategy to end unregulated placements remains **unpublished**\n\nIn Wales:\n\n- A landmark bill passed in 2025 to **phase out profit in children’s care**\n\n- But the transition won’t be complete until **2030**\n\n- In the meantime, local authorities still rely on temporary, unregulated solutions when capacity runs out\n\nThere is no national emergency declared. No inquiry. No justice for the children already harmed.\n\nWhen a system fails this hard — and no one is held accountable — it becomes clear: **this isn’t neglect. It’s permission.**\n\n---\n\n## What Needs to Happen Next\n\nThis isn’t just a policy failure. It’s a moral collapse.\n\nChildren are being housed in illegal buildings, by untrained staff, under the noses of the very people paid to protect them. No more reviews. No more gentle guidance. What’s needed now is action — hard, urgent, unapologetic action.\n\n**We need:**\n\n- **Immediate criminalisation** of placing any child in an unregistered setting — not just under-16s\n\n- **Emergency powers** to shut down illegal homes and block providers who rebrand to avoid detection\n\n- **Whistleblower protections** for frontline staff raising concerns about illegal or dangerous care\n\n- **A publicly searchable registry** of care providers, ownership structures, and inspection histories\n\n- **An independent watchdog** to investigate systemic placement breaches across all UK nations\n\n- **Direct input from care-experienced young people** into national policy and placement reviews\n\nThe system cannot fix itself. It has shown us that again and again. Reform must be led by survivors, watchdogs outside of government, and those brave enough to blow the whistle from inside.\n\n---\n\n## Not One More Child\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000606c6243aa138c812bbbce435793624897514656147.png?w=1024)\n\nThey’ll say there’s not enough money.\n\nThey’ll say it’s a placement crisis.\n\nThey’ll say they’re doing their best.\n\nBut what do we say to the 14-year-old left alone in a room with no staff?\nWhat do we say to the girl moved across four illegal homes in a year?\nWhat do we say to the children who went missing — and never came back?\n\nWe say this:\n\nYou were never the problem.\nThey were.\nYou were never the burden.\nThey cashed in.\nYou were never too hard to love.\nThey were too cold to care.\n\nThis is not a historic failure.\nIt’s a living one.\n\nAnd we say clearly now:\n**Not one more child.**","src/content/articles/the-kids-the-system-sold-off-the-illegal-care-crisis-in-england-and-wales.md","3748ad9884627305",{"html":4999,"metadata":5000},"\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis | The Indie Leaks | The Grooming Files | @realtalkrealtea\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000b490620aac9eee580ff4a2b22629574911050726368.png?w=683\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They weren’t just failed.

A deputy head teacher. Trusted with safeguarding vulnerable girls.\n\nCatherine Pearl sexually abused a pupil for years, including on school grounds.\n\nOn 24 January 2025, at Oxford Crown Court, she was sentenced to 2 years and 4 months in prison.\n\nMost people have never heard of her.\n\nBut everyone knows about Rebecca Joynes, the 30-year-old Manchester teacher who groomed two teenage boys, became pregnant by one, and received 6.5 years.\n\n**Why?**\n\nBecause we're conditioned to see male predators. Female ones operate in a blind spot we refuse to acknowledge.\n\nAnd that invisibility is costing children their safety.\n\n---\n\n## TWO CASES, TWO CONVICTIONS, ONE INVISIBLE PATTERN\n\n### **January 2025: Catherine Pearl**\n\n**The Facts:**\n\nCatherine Pearl, aged 50, from Abingdon, worked as deputy head teacher at Didcot Girls' School in Oxfordshire whilst her victim was a pupil at the school.\n\nShe pleaded guilty in November 2024 to two counts of sexual activity with a girl as an adult abusing a position of trust.\n\nShe was sentenced to 2 years and 4 months in prison at Oxford Crown Court on Friday, 24 January 2025, by Judge Emma Nott.\n\n**The Timeline:**\n\n- Offences reported to Thames Valley Police in 2023\n\n- Pearl arrested on 9 August 2023\n\n- Charged on 10 October 2024\n\n- Pleaded guilty November 2024\n\n- Sentenced 24 January 2025\n\n**What the Court Established:**\n\nThe Court of Appeal judgement in July 2025 confirmed that Pearl's offending:\n\n- Occurred over \"a period of years\"\n\n- Was \"very serious\"\n\n- \"had a terrible impact\" on the victim\n\nThe original sentencing judge (Judge Emma Nott) \"was plainly right in our opinion to take a very serious view of it.\"\n\nPearl was initially given a 10-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) which included restrictions on internet-capable devices and contact with children. Parts of this were later deemed \"unnecessary and disproportionate\" by the Court of Appeal and replaced with a ban on seeking or holding any position of authority or care of children, lasting until January 2035.\n\n**Police Statement:**\n\nDetective Constable Sarah Tibble, investigating officer, said the victim \"had shown such bravery in coming forward to report the offences and put her trust in Thames Valley Police to bring Catherine Pearl to justice.\"\n\n**Institutional Response:**\n\nFollowing sentencing, Didcot Girls' School removed social media posts featuring Pearl from a 2019 assembly. Head teacher Georgina Littler confirmed the posts were deleted on 27 January 2025.\n\n**Media Coverage:**\n\nLocal BBC coverage, Oxford Mail, local court podcast. No national headlines.\n\n---\n\n### **July 2024: Rebecca Joynes**\n\n**The Facts:**\n\nRebecca Joynes, aged 30 (date of birth 30/12/1993), from Salford, was a teacher at a Manchester high school.\n\nShe was convicted by a jury following a nine-day trial at Manchester Crown Court in May 2024.\n\n**The Charges:**\n\n- 4 counts: Sexual activity with a child\n\n- 2 counts: Sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust\n\nShe was found guilty of all six offences.\n\n**Sentencing:**\n\nOn 4 July 2024, Joynes was sentenced to 6.5 years in prison.\n\nShe was also made subject to:\n\n- Notification requirements as a registered sex offender for life\n\n- Sexual Harm Prevention Order for 10 years\n\n- Restraining orders in relation to both boys\n\n[SOURCE: CPS]\n\n**What the Court Established:**\n\n**Boy A:**\n\nJoynes gave one of the boys she taught most of the digits of her phone number and he guessed the rest.\n\nWhen he began contacting her, Joynes reciprocated. On 5 October 2021, she arranged for the 15-year-old boy to stay overnight at her home.\n\nShe took him to the Trafford Centre where she bought him a £345 belt. They then returned to her flat and engaged in sexual intercourse.\n\nWhen she was arrested, she made no comment in her police interview. She was then charged with sexual activity with a child and suspended from her teaching job.\n\n**Boy B:**\n\nWhilst suspended and on bail in respect of the first offences, a second 15-year-old boy was targeted by Joynes.\n\nThe pair engaged in a sexual relationship, which only ended when Joynes was arrested.\n\n**Her Defence:**\n\nJoynes claimed there was no sexual contact between her and the first schoolboy and claimed sexual contact did not take place with the second boy until he was 16 and after she had been dismissed from her job.\n\nThe jury rejected this defence and found her guilty on all counts.\n\n**CPS Statement:**\n\nJane Wilson, Senior Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West, said:\n\n\"Rebecca Joynes was in a position of trust as a high school teacher. She abused her position to groom and exploit two schoolboys in the worst way, with no thought for the lasting impact it would have on them. Every parent sends their children to school expecting them to be safeguarded and taken care of; Joynes's actions have eroded that trust. I would like to thank the victims for supporting the prosecution. I hope they can start to move forward knowing Joynes has been held accountable for her actions.\"\n\n**Media Coverage:**\n\nNational headlines across BBC, ITV, multiple news outlets. Extensive coverage. Public awareness high.\n\n---\n\n## THE PATTERN IN THE BLIND SPOT\n\n**What Both Cases Involved:**\n\nBoth women:\n\n- Held positions of trust in schools [VERIFIED: CPS, BBC]\n\n- Had explicit safeguarding responsibilities [VERIFIED: CPS statement re: \"position of trust\"]\n\n- Groomed vulnerable teenagers in their care [VERIFIED: Court convictions]\n\n- Were convicted in UK courts of sexual offences against children [VERIFIED: Court records]\n\n- Received custodial sentences [VERIFIED: Court records]\n\n**The Sentencing:**\n\n- Catherine Pearl (deputy head, years of abuse): 2 years 4 months\n\n- Rebecca Joynes (teacher, two victims): 6.5 years\n\n**The Media Response:**\n\n- Catherine Pearl: Local coverage only\n\n- Rebecca Joynes: National headlines\n\n**One became a household name. The other is virtually unknown.**\n\n---\n\n## THE STATISTICAL REALITY\n\nResearch consistently shows a gap between offending rates and conviction rates for female sex offenders.\n\n**What Research Shows:**\n\n- 1 in 6 boys experience sexual abuse before age 18\n\n- Studies estimate 20 to 40% of child sexual abuse involves female perpetrators\n\n- UK conviction data shows female offenders represent approximately 5% of sex offence convictions\n\n**That gap–between 20 to 40% involvement and 5% convictions–requires explanation.**\n\nEither:\n\n- Research is systematically overestimating female offending, or\n\n- We are systematically under-recognising, under-reporting, and under-prosecuting female sex offenders\n\nAvailable evidence points to option 2.\n\n---\n\n## WHY INVISIBILITY MATTERS\n\n**For Victims:**\n\nWhen your abuser doesn't fit the cultural script of what a predator looks like, you face unique barriers:\n\n- You may not recognise what's happening as abuse\n\n- You have limited language to describe your experience\n\n- You may not be believed when you report\n\n- The harm may be minimised\n\n- Sentencing may not reflect the damage caused\n\n**For Prevention:**\n\nWe teach children to watch for male predators:\n\n- \"Don't talk to strange men\"\n\n- \"Be careful of male teachers who get too friendly\"\n\n- \"Watch out for coaches who are too hands-on\"\n\nWe rarely say:\n\n- \"Female teachers can abuse their position too\"\n\n- \"A woman buying you expensive gifts might be grooming you\"\n\n- \"Your female youth worker developing inappropriate closeness is dangerous\"\n\n**For Institutions:**\n\nWhen female predators are invisible, institutions lack frameworks to:\n\n- Recognise warning signs\n\n- Respond appropriately to concerns\n\n- Prevent offending before it occurs\n\n---\n\n## THE CULTURAL SCRIPT PROBLEM\n\nSociety positions women as inherently protective. Mothers. Nurturers. Caregivers. Teachers as second mothers.\n\nThis isn't just a stereotype. It creates operational cover.\n\n**Consider:**\n\nA male teacher arranging for a 15-year-old student to stay overnight at his home would immediately trigger safeguarding alarms.\n\nRebecca Joynes did exactly that on 5 October 2021.\n\nA male teacher buying a teenage student a £345 designer belt would raise immediate red flags.\n\nRebecca Joynes did exactly that before engaging in sexual intercourse with the boy.\n\nThe protective framing creates a safeguarding blind spot.\n\nAnd predators operate in blind spots.\n\n---\n\n## TWO TEACHERS. TWO CONVICTIONS. ONE INVISIBLE PATTERN.\n\n**Catherine Pearl:**\n\n- Age 50\n\n- Deputy head teacher\n\n- Abused pupil over years\n\n- Sentenced: 2 years 4 months\n\n- Media coverage: Local only\n\n**Rebecca Joynes:**\n\n- Age 30\n\n- Teacher\n\n- Two victims, both 15\n\n- Whilst on bail for first offence, targeted second boy\n\n- Sentenced: 6.5 years\n\n- Media coverage: National headlines\n\n**Both are predators.**\n\n**Both caused serious harm.**\n\n**Both were convicted in UK courts.**\n\n**One is famous. One is forgotten.**\n\n**That's the invisibility problem.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT COMES NEXT\n\nIn **Part 2** of this series, we'll examine the protective framing problem in depth–how cultural assumptions about women as nurturers create operational advantages for female predators.\n\nIn **Part 3**, we'll analyse the different tactics female predators use with male versus female victims, and why understanding these distinctions matters for prevention.\n\nIn **Part 4**, we'll investigate the sentencing gap–why female sex offenders consistently receive lighter sentences than male offenders for comparable crimes.\n\nIn **Part 5**, we'll examine what Catherine Pearl and Rebecca Joynes teach us about prevention, recognition, and breaking the cycle of invisibility.\n\n**The question isn't whether female predators exist.**\n\n**The question is: how many are we missing because we refuse to see them?**\n\n---\n\n## SOURCES & VERIFICATION\n\nAll facts in this article are drawn from:\n\n**Catherine Pearl case:**\n\n- BBC News, 27 January 2025: \"Didcot: Former assistant head jailed for sexually assaulting pupil\"\n\n- BBC News, July 30, 2025: \"Jailed Didcot teacher who groomed girl wins partial appeal\"\n\n- Court of Appeal judgement, July 2025 (referenced in BBC reporting)\n\n- Thames Valley Police statements (as quoted in BBC News)\n\n**Rebecca Joynes case:**\n\n- Crown Prosecution Service press release, 4 July 2024: \"Former high school teacher jailed for child sexual offences against pupils\"\n\n- Manchester Crown Court proceedings, May 2024\n\n- CPS statements (Senior Crown Prosecutor Jane Wilson)\n\n**Statistical data:**\n\n- CDC data on childhood sexual abuse prevalence\n\n- Academic research on female perpetrator prevalence\n\n- Ministry of Justice conviction data\n\n---\n\n## RESOURCES & SUPPORT\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this article:\n\n**Stop It Now UK** – Confidential helpline for preventing child sexual abuse\nhttps://www.stopitnow.org.uk\n\n**NAPAC** – Support for adult survivors of childhood abuse\nhttps://napac.org.uk\n\n**Survivors UK** – Support for male survivors\nhttps://www.survivorsuk.org\n\n**The Survivors Trust** – Specialist support services\nhttps://www.thesurvivorstrust.org\n\n**If a child is at immediate risk:**\nUK: Call 999 (emergency) or 101 (non-emergency)\n\n---\n\n## ABOUT THIS RESEARCH\n\nThis article is based exclusively on publicly available court documents, official statements from the Crown Prosecution Service and police forces, verified media reporting from established news outlets (BBC, official court reporters), and Court of Appeal judgements.

THEY TOOK VOTES. THEY HURT CHILDREN.**\n\nThis isn't a headline from a dystopian novel.\nIt’s the truth about dozens of UK politicians—MPs, councillors, mayors, and party officials—**convicted of child rape, abuse, indecent images, and sexual exploitation.**\n\nAcross all major political parties.\n\n**Tories. Labour. Lib Dems. UKIP. Independents.**\n\nThey didn't just offend.\nThey were elected. Respected. Trusted.\n**And many walked away with suspended sentences, media silence, or no coverage at all.**\n\n---\n\nTonight, *The Indie Leaks* publishes **a collection of public cases too often scattered and forgotten**, buried in local papers or erased from memory.\n\nWe aren’t here to shock.\nWe’re here to **expose the elite protection machine** that lets paedophiles campaign, serve, and abuse—under the cover of office.\n\n**This is not a partisan exposé. It’s a truth the entire political class should answer for.**\n\n---\n\n**Let’s tear it open, Soph.** Here's the next section—your first **Selected Offenders** block. All names, dates, parties, crimes, and outcomes are taken *directly* from the screenshots you uploaded. Pure truth, no fluff.\n\n---\n\n### **SELECTED OFFENDERS: WHEN POLITICS MET PAEDOPHILIA**\n\n**Frank Beck — Lib Dem Councillor**\n**Convicted:** 1991\n**Crimes:** 17 charges including rape, buggery, indecent assault, and abuse of boys and girls.\n**Sentence:** Five life terms.\n\n> \n> A judge called him “a man with considerable talents and very great evil.” Beck was a leading childcare worker at the time of arrest.\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n**Eric Joyce — MP**\n**Convicted:** 2020\n**Crimes:** Live viewing of baby rape videos.\n**Sentence:** Suspended sentence.\n\n> \n> No prison time. No national political inquiry.\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n**Harvey Proctor — Tory MP (Billericay/Essex)**\n**Convicted:** 1987\n**Crimes:** Sado-masochistic sex offences against teenage boys.\n**Sentence:** Fined £1,450 and forced to resign.\n\n> \n> Returned to public life years later with media support.\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n**Phillip Leivers — Independent Councillor**\n**Convicted:** 2014\n**Crimes:** Sexual assault of a nine-year-old girl.\n**Details:** Touched the child during a “guess the colour of her underwear” game.\n**Outcome:** Admitted guilt. Walked free.\n\n---\n\n**Nicholas Green — Labour Mayor (Westhoughton)**\n**Convicted:** 2006\n**Crimes:** 3 rapes and 13 indecent assaults against girls aged 6–10.\n**Sentence:** 10 years in prison.\n\n> \n> Raped a woman on her wedding day. Served as mayor while abusing children.\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n**Toren Smith — Former Labour Councillor (Lambeth)**\n**Convicted:** 2011\n**Crimes:** Possession of over 94,000 indecent images and videos of abused children.\n**Sentence:** Two-year suspended sentence.\n\n> \n> A child protection charity slammed the ruling as “appallingly lenient.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n**Brian Deacon — UKIP Parish Councillor**\n**Convicted:** 2014\n**Crimes:** Six counts of sexually touching a girl under 13.\n**Location:** Helston\n**Outcome:** Pled guilty. Received community sentencing. No national party statement issued.\n\n---\n\nThese aren’t accusations. These are **convictions**, rulings, and documented abuse cases.\n\nAnd they’re only the beginning.\n\n---\n\n### **THE PATTERN OF PROTECTION**\n\nThis isn’t a rogue’s gallery.\nThis is a **power pattern**—played over decades, across party lines.\n\nAnd once you see it, you can’t unsee it:\n\n---\n\n**1. Resignations Before Arrests**\n\n> \n> Politicians quietly step down just before charges drop—dodging headlines, party expulsion, and public scrutiny.\n> **Example:** Peter Hill Jones (Tory councillor) resigned *days* after his sex offence shame surfaced—right after winning re-election.\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n**2. Suspended Sentences & Slaps on the Wrist**\n\n> \n> From baby rape viewing to 90,000 child abuse images—many walked free.\n> Courts cited “first offences,” “community ties,” or “age” as mitigating factors.\n> **Result:** Survivors see no justice. Offenders avoid prison. The cycle continues.\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n**3. Lack of Media Coverage**\n\n> \n> These weren’t front-page headlines.\n> Most of these convictions appeared only in **local press**, archived out of view.\n> Some? Not covered at all.\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n**4. Political Parties Went Silent**\n\n> \n> No expulsion notices.\n> No formal statements.\n> No safeguarding reforms.\n> From Tories to Labour, Lib Dem to UKIP—**zero accountability** once the resignation hits.\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n**5. Return to Influence**\n\n> \n> Some offenders later re-emerged as campaigners, columnists, or commentators.\n> Because if you’re high enough up the ladder, **your fall is cushioned**.\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\nThis wasn’t about hiding monsters in the basement.\nThis was **putting them on the council**, giving them seats at committees, and handing them influence.\n\n> \n> The UK political establishment didn’t just ignore abuse.\n> It systemised how to survive it.\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n### **THIS ISN’T HISTORY. IT’S HABIT.**\n\nFrom Parliament chambers to parish halls, they walked in as “public servants” and left as convicted predators.\nAnd we, the people, were never told the full truth.\n\nThis isn’t about old names.\nIt’s about a **structure that still exists**, still shields, and still **selectively forgets**.\n\nBecause when you protect a predator once, you build a blueprint.\nAnd **British politics perfected it.**\n\n---\n\n### **THE PROOF IS BELOW**\n\nEvery screenshot. Every record. Every name.\n\nThese are not allegations.\nThese are **archived convictions**, many of them public—yet buried in obscurity, shame, and silence.\n\nAn online source has published them all.\n**Use them. Share them. Save them. Spread them.**\nBecause this data should’ve been front page **decades ago.**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046442861660238543123660920.jpg?w=601)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046423287519872958629760759.jpg?w=607)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046401241746971913258419362.jpg?w=591)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046380044299502525461013318.jpg?w=595)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046341466570935041253871492.jpg?w=596)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046318173074762882240197419.jpg?w=610)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_1743804629478193605178703921476.jpg?w=599)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046272344032661307012872715.jpg?w=599)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046251135620436241253979437.jpg?w=601)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046223392984861945366977727.jpg?w=604)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046184811991895398542910279.jpg?w=587)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046148335482439781023336253.jpg?w=597)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046119307611188826875572273.jpg?w=594)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046099161590565618905306208.jpg?w=602)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046078217710525263380739979.jpg?w=596)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046055723281090236614048963.jpg?w=620)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046036062405722431769993866.jpg?w=596)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438046014943730499632391616380.jpg?w=604)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045991887689907856824334884.jpg?w=596)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045962116361396151983967052.jpg?w=596)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045937338572431801664916002.jpg?w=601)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_1743804591255230724728144860100.jpg?w=599)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045888982129582097304752451.jpg?w=601)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045858448568846389164203599.jpg?w=596)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045841223347053232572756795.jpg?w=596)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_1743804582439124389751202963931.jpg?w=601)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045807717279536328500567418.jpg?w=593)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_1743804579004233022538733057410.jpg?w=621)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045771747378836442475711926.jpg?w=614)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045754174436271827045829052.jpg?w=583)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045734654888858453346810413.jpg?w=599)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17438045714502748930750397590958.jpg?w=598)\n\n---\n\n### **WHY THIS MATTERS NOW**\n\nBecause some of these people **still hold influence**.\nBecause survivors were left **without justice**.\nAnd because **if this many were caught—how many were missed?**\n\n---\n\n**This isn’t the end.

It’s trauma.\nBut the courtroom often sees it as “unreliable.”\n\nAnd so, truth is misread as doubt.\nAnd the benefit of that doubt goes to the accused, not the victim.\n\n---\n\n## The Pressure to Be the “Perfect Witness”\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000773462468986fdbb72315a153510187164501202575.png?w=1024)\n\nSurvivors are expected to:\n\n- Report quickly\n\n- Remain consistent\n\n- Explain everything clearly\n\n- Show just enough emotion (but not too much)\n\n- Be calm, credible, and detailed\n\n- Not have mental health issues\n\n- Not have been drinking, using, or struggling\n\nThat’s not just unrealistic, it’s cruel.\n\nEspecially when many survivors *do* turn to coping strategies.\nOr struggle with mental health.\nOr delay disclosure until something finally breaks inside them.\n\nThe result?\nSurvivors are often dismissed as “unreliable”, not because their abuse didn’t happen, but because their *healing* got in the way of the legal ideal.\n\n---\n\n## And What About the Ones Who Speak Up Anyway?\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000073e86243aa4c5da70e70ca694357115804593874082.png?w=683)\n\nFor those who do go to court, the process is often retraumatising:\n\n- Being cross-examined for hours\n\n- Having their sexual history dragged out\n\n- Facing their abuser in the same room\n\n- Having to “prove” pain to a jury\n\n- Seeing their own words twisted by defence teams\n\nIt’s not justice.\nIt’s a test they never signed up for.\nAnd many leave feeling more violated by the system than by the person who harmed them.\n\n---\n\n## The System Protects Power Not Vulnerability\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000016e46246ae24d3ed01463c8f_conversation_id3d6802dfc3-40c4-8002-87a2-7ee22facea6326message_id3dfee6c00f-6349-4ea2-a3a6-7c9da67e22b53131723056762709570.jpg?w=1024)\n\nWhy is it that:\n\n- A single accusation of theft can lead to arrest\n\n- But three disclosures of abuse get “filed away”\n\n- A burglar is caught on CCTV and prosecuted\n\n- But a child’s words are not enough?\n\nBecause the legal system wasn’t built with child sexual abuse in mind.\nIt was built for visible crime. Tangible harm. Clean evidence. Clear timelines.\n\nBut abuse doesn’t come gift-wrapped like that.\nAnd predators know it.\n\nThat’s why so many keep offending and why so many victims stay silent.\nBecause deep down, they know the system doesn’t hear whispers. It only listens to shouts with signatures attached.\n\n---\n\n## What Real Justice Would Look Like\n\nIt’s not just about courtrooms. It’s about belief. About listening. About power shifting.\n\nReal justice would mean:\n\n- Trauma-informed legal training for judges, juries, police, and CPS\n\n- No more reliance on perfect memory or instant reporting\n\n- Safe, supported disclosure processes, especially for children\n\n- Sentencing that reflects the lifelong impact of abuse\n\n- Community belief systems that don’t demand proof before they protect\n\nJustice begins long before a trial and often without one.\n\nBecause many survivors don’t want a courtroom.\nThey want validation.

It creates operational advantages for predators.\n\n---\n\n## THE PROTECTIVE FRAMING: WHAT IT IS\n\nProtective framing is the automatic, culturally embedded assumption that women, particularly in maternal or educational roles, are inherently safe.\n\n**It operates at three levels:**\n\n- **Cultural**: \"Women don't do that\"\n\n- **Institutional**: \"She's like a second mother to these children\"\n\n- **Individual**: \"She couldn't possibly…\"\n\nThis isn't conscious bias. It's deeper than that.\n\nIt's a set of assumptions so embedded they shape what we see, what we question, and what we report.\n\n---\n\n## LEVEL 1: CULTURAL PROTECTIVE FRAMING\n\n### **The \"Women Don't Do That\" Default**\n\nWhen Rebecca Joynes took a 15 year old boy to the Trafford Centre and bought him a £345 designer belt before taking him home for sex, multiple people were involved in that transaction.\n\nShop assistants. Security guards. People in the shopping centre.\n\nNo one reported it.\n\n**Why?**\n\nBecause a young woman buying an expensive gift for a teenage boy reads as:\n\n- Generous girlfriend with younger partner (acceptable)\n\n- Kind teacher helping struggling student (admirable)\n\n- Big sister figure treating younger relative (sweet)\n\n**It doesn't read as: grooming.**\n\nNow reverse the genders.\n\nA 30 year old man taking a 15 year old girl shopping. Buying her expensive gifts. Taking her back to his flat.\n\nThat triggers immediate alarm.\n\n**Not because the behaviour is different.**\n\n**Because the framing is different.**\n\n---\n\n### **The Language Gap**\n\nConsider how we describe identical behaviour:\n\n**Male teacher + female student:**\n\n- \"Predatory\"\n\n- \"Grooming\"\n\n- \"Sexual assault\"\n\n- \"Rape\"\n\n**Female teacher + male student:**\n\n- \"Affair\"\n\n- \"Relationship\"\n\n- \"Inappropriate contact\"\n\n- \"Sex romp\"\n\nThe BBC coverage of Rebecca Joynes used appropriate terms: \"sexual activity with a child,\" \"grooming,\" \"abuse of position of trust.\"\n\nBut look at tabloid coverage of similar cases. Headlines often frame it as scandalous rather than predatory.\n\n**Language shapes perception.**\n\n**Perception shapes response.**\n\n**Response determines whether predators are stopped.**\n\n---\n\n## LEVEL 2: INSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIVE FRAMING\n\n### **Catherine Pearl: Deputy Head Teacher**\n\nPearl wasn't just a teacher. She was deputy head at Didcot Girls' School.\n\nHer role included:\n\n- Safeguarding oversight\n\n- Staff supervision\n\n- Policy implementation\n\n- Pastoral care responsibility\n\nShe was *the person responsible for preventing abuse.*\n\n**And she was committing it.**\n\nOver a period of years.\n\nIncluding on school premises.\n\n**How did that go undetected?**\n\nBecause institutions operate on the same protective framing assumptions as the wider culture.\n\nA female deputy head developing close relationships with vulnerable girls reads as:\n\n- \"She's so dedicated\"\n\n- \"She really cares about these students\"\n\n- \"She goes above and beyond\"\n\n**The exact behaviours that should trigger concern become evidence of dedication.**\n\n---\n\n### **Rebecca Joynes: The Bail Period**\n\nAfter being arrested for sexual activity with Boy A, Joynes was:\n\n- Suspended from her teaching position\n\n- Placed on bail\n\n- Subject to safeguarding restrictions\n\n**While on bail, she targeted Boy B.**\n\nThis represents a catastrophic institutional failure.\n\n**But it's also predictable within a protective framing context:**\n\nBecause even when a female teacher is *arrested* for child sexual abuse, the default assumption remains: \"This must be a misunderstanding.\"\n\nThe protective framing is so powerful it survives an arrest.\n\nA male teacher arrested for sexually abusing a student would face:\n\n- Immediate community awareness\n\n- Social isolation\n\n- Intense scrutiny\n\n- Difficulty accessing potential victims\n\nJoynes was able to continue offending because the protective framing created operational space even *after law enforcement intervention.*\n\n---\n\n## LEVEL 3: INDIVIDUAL PROTECTIVE FRAMING\n\n### **\"She Couldn't Possibly…\"**\n\nVictims of female sexual abuse face unique disclosure barriers.\n\n**For male victims:**\n\nWhen a teenage boy is sexually abused by a female teacher, cultural scripts tell him:\n\n- \"You're lucky\"\n\n- \"I wish my teacher had done that\"\n\n- \"What are you complaining about?\"\n\n- \"That's every boy's fantasy\"\n\nThis isn't support. It's denial of victimisation.\n\nThe protective framing of women means his abuse is reframed as:\n\n- Initiation\n\n- Sexual education\n\n- A gift\n\n- Good fortune\n\n**He may not recognise it as abuse.**\n\n**When he does, he may not be believed.**\n\n**When he's believed, the harm may be minimised.**\n\n---\n\n**For female victims:**\n\nWhen a teenage girl is abused by a female teacher, she faces different but equally powerful barriers.\n\nThe protective framing of women, particularly in same sex contexts, means:\n\n- The abuse may not be recognised as sexual\n\n- It may be framed as \"mentoring\" or \"special friendship\"\n\n- There's limited cultural language to describe female perpetrated sexual abuse of girls\n\n- Reporting may require confronting both homophobic assumptions and protective framing simultaneously\n\nCatherine Pearl's victim showed \"such bravery in coming forward\" (Detective Constable Sarah Tibble, Thames Valley Police).\n\n**That bravery had to overcome:**\n\n- The authority differential (deputy head teacher)\n\n- The trust relationship (safeguarding role)\n\n- The protective framing (women don't do that)\n\n- The institutional investment in denial (reputational damage to school)\n\n---\n\n## HOW PROTECTIVE FRAMING CREATES OPERATIONAL ADVANTAGES\n\n### **Advantage 1: Access**\n\nFemale teachers, youth workers, and caregivers have automatic, unsupervised access to children in ways male counterparts don't.\n\nA male teacher arranging one on one time with a student after hours triggers questions.\n\nA female teacher doing the same reads as dedication.\n\n**This isn't about banning female teachers from pastoral care.**\n\n**It's about recognising that predators exploit trust, and protective framing maximises trust.**\n\n---\n\n### **Advantage 2: Normalisation of Physical Contact**\n\nWomen in caregiving roles engage in physical contact that would raise immediate concerns if performed by men:\n\n- Hugs\n\n- Sitting close\n\n- Physical comfort during emotional distress\n\n- Casual touch\n\n**Most of this contact is entirely appropriate.**\n\nBut predators exploit the grey areas.\n\nThey use culturally normalised behaviours to:\n\n- Test boundaries\n\n- Desensitise victims\n\n- Create plausible deniability\n\nThe protective framing makes it harder to identify when contact crosses from appropriate to grooming.\n\n---\n\n### **Advantage 3: Institutional Protection**\n\nWhen concerns are raised about male teachers, institutions often respond swiftly (sometimes too swiftly, leading to false accusations being taken as fact before investigation).\n\nWhen concerns are raised about female teachers, institutions often respond with:\n\n- \"Are you sure you're not misunderstanding?\"\n\n- \"She's always been wonderful with students\"\n\n- \"Could this be a personality conflict?\"\n\n- \"Let's not jump to conclusions\"\n\n**The protective framing creates institutional hesitancy.**\n\n**Hesitancy creates time.**\n\n**Time creates more victims.**\n\n---\n\n## THE EVIDENCE: SENTENCING AS A PROXY FOR PROTECTIVE FRAMING\n\nSentencing data provides measurable evidence of protective framing in action.\n\n**Catherine Pearl:**\n\n- Deputy head teacher\n\n- Abused position of trust\n\n- Offending over \"years\"\n\n- Impact described as \"terrible\"\n\n- **Sentence: 2 years 4 months**\n\n**Rebecca Joynes:**\n\n- Teacher\n\n- Two victims\n\n- Continued offending while on bail\n\n- **Sentence: 6.5 years**\n\n**Methodological note:** Direct statistical comparison of sentences between male and female teachers convicted of similar offences requires systematic case by case analysis beyond the scope of this article. However, preliminary review of reported cases suggests substantial sentencing disparities that warrant further investigation. Analysis of Ministry of Justice sentencing data and comparative case studies will be addressed in Part 4 of this series.\n\n**The observable gap in these two female perpetrator cases alone raises questions:**\n\nWhen judges, juries, and the public view female offenders through a protective frame, the same behaviour may be seen as:\n\n- Less predatory\n\n- Less planned\n\n- Less harmful\n\n- More aberrational (\"out of character\")\n\n**The protective framing follows defendants into the courtroom.**\n\n---\n\n## WHY THIS MATTERS FOR SAFEGUARDING\n\n### **Recognition**\n\nIf female predators don't match our mental image of what predators look like, we won't recognise warning signs:\n\n- Excessive gift giving ✓ (Joynes: £345 belt)\n\n- Boundary violations ✓ (Joynes: overnight stay)\n\n- Isolation of victims ✓ (Both cases)\n\n- Abuse of position ✓ (Both cases)\n\n- Grooming behaviours ✓ (Both cases)\n\n**These are textbook predator behaviours.**\n\n**We missed them because the perpetrators were women.**\n\n---\n\n### **Response**\n\nEven when concerns are raised, protective framing slows institutional response:\n\n- Reports are questioned more intensely\n\n- Alternative explanations are sought first\n\n- Benefit of the doubt extends longer\n\n- Investigation thresholds are higher\n\n**Delay = more victims.**\n\n---\n\n### **Prevention**\n\nSafeguarding training typically focuses on male predators:\n\n- \"Warning signs to watch for in male staff\"\n\n- \"How male coaches might groom athletes\"\n\n- \"Boundary violations by male teachers\"\n\n**We need gender neutral safeguarding frameworks that recognise:**\n\n- Predators come in all genders\n\n- Protective framing creates blind spots\n\n- Warning signs are about behaviour, not gender\n\n- Trust is what predators exploit, regardless of who holds it\n\n---\n\n## THE DIDCOT GIRLS' SCHOOL RESPONSE: A CASE STUDY IN PROTECTIVE FRAMING\n\nAfter Catherine Pearl's sentencing on 24 January 2025, Didcot Girls' School deleted social media posts featuring Pearl from a 2019 assembly.\n\nThis happened on 27 January 2025: three days after sentencing.\n\n**Those posts had been public for 6 years.**\n\n**They were only removed after a convicted child sex offender appeared in them.**\n\n**What does this tell us?**\n\nThat even after:\n\n- Police investigation (2023)\n\n- Arrest (August 2023)\n\n- Charging (October 2024)\n\n- Guilty plea (November 2024)\n\n- Sentencing (January 2025)\n\n…the school maintained public content celebrating Pearl until *after* she was convicted and sentenced.\n\n**This is protective framing in institutional action.**\n\nThe desire to preserve institutional reputation and avoid confronting the reality of female perpetration delayed even basic reputational management.\n\n---\n\n## BREAKING THE FRAME\n\n**Acknowledging protective framing doesn't mean:**\n\n- Viewing all female teachers with suspicion\n\n- Removing women from caregiving roles\n\n- Assuming women are as likely to offend as men (they're not)\n\n**It means:**\n\n- Recognising that predators exploit whatever trust structures exist\n\n- Implementing gender neutral safeguarding that focuses on behaviour, not demographics\n\n- Training staff to recognise warning signs regardless of perpetrator gender\n\n- Taking reports seriously regardless of who is accused\n\n- Ensuring institutional responses aren't delayed by cultural assumptions\n\n**Catherine Pearl abused her victim for years while serving as deputy head.**\n\n**Rebecca Joynes continued offending while on bail.**\n\n**The protective framing didn't protect children.**\n\n**It protected predators.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT COMES NEXT\n\nIn **Part 3**, we'll examine how female predators adapt their tactics based on victim gender: why the grooming of male victims looks different from the grooming of female victims, and what this tells us about predator sophistication.\n\nIn **Part 4**, we'll investigate the sentencing gap in depth: comparing sentences across cases and analysing what judicial language reveals about protective framing in courtrooms.\n\nIn **Part 5**, we'll examine prevention: what Catherine Pearl and Rebecca Joynes teach us about recognition, response, and breaking the cycle of invisibility.\n\n**The protective framing of women isn't inevitable.**\n\n**It's a cultural choice.**\n\n**And we can choose differently.**\n\n---\n\n## SOURCES & VERIFICATION\n\nAll facts in this article are drawn from:\n\n**Catherine Pearl case:**\n\n- BBC News, 27 January 2025\n\n- BBC

No denial. Just a confession — sent to a survivor. Me.\n\nHe said he was a danger. He said he’d done it before. He said the system didn’t work, and I was the only one who could hold him accountable. His name was Chris.\n\nWeeks later, it happened again. Another predator. Another unsolicited confession. His name was Matt.\n\nBoth said the same thing: \"I don’t trust myself. But I trust you.\"\n\nThey didn’t want help. They wanted containment. Shame. Surveillance. They came not to run from consequence but to submit to it.\n\nI didn’t know it yet, but those messages were more than confessions. They were symptoms of a pattern. A new behavioural category no one had named:\n\n**The exposure-seeking offender.**\n\nThis wasn’t about guilt. It was about ritual. Control. Dependency. And the collapse of every safeguarding system that should have caught them but didn’t.\n\nThey didn’t come to be stopped. They came to be held. By me. A survivor. And I had no choice but to document what happened next.\n\n---\n\n## The Inbox Becomes the Crime Scene\n\nChris was first. His messages weren’t aggressive. They were calm, rehearsed. He said he was dangerous. He wanted to be seen. Punished. Exposed. I agreed to interview him.\n\nNot out of curiosity. Out of necessity. Because I knew instantly: this wasn’t drama. This was documentation.\n\nHe answered everything. Then kept messaging. He asked for more interviews. For punishment. For exposure. He offered money.\n\nIt wasn’t about remorse. It was about obsession. Exposure became a ritual. Shame became a drug.\n\nI called it a one-off.\n\nThen Matt messaged.\n\nAustralian. Mid-thirties. Convicted. Calm. Direct. He said he was a danger. He'd contacted sting groups. No one helped. He wanted to be exposed.\n\nHe confessed to daily fantasies. Real children. Public places. Images online. He admitted everything. And no one, no group, no service, no system stepped in.\n\nSo he clung to me.\n\nHe asked to be monitored. Sent forensic answers. Called me his lifeline. Paid for a second interview.\n\nAnd I wasn’t law enforcement. I wasn’t a therapist. I was a survivor, holding a confession in real time.\n\nThis wasn’t journalism. This was containment. And the crime was the silence.\n\n---\n\n## Shame as Structure, Exposure as Sedation\n\nBoth Chris and Matt weren’t chasing justice. They were chasing structure. And shame became the only structure they recognised.\n\nConfession. Submission. Surveillance. Collapse. Repeat.\n\nMatt followed a routine. Daily check-ins. Reflections. Vaulted confessions. Chris begged for destruction.\n\nIt wasn’t deterrence. It was sedation. Exposure calmed them. Humiliation kept them anchored.\n\nThey weren’t afraid of consequences. They craved them. Because consequences gave them form.\n\nAnd when the state didn’t show up, I did. Not as hero. As last resort.\n\n---\n\n## The System I Built Myself\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_000000006c7061f490de0a794fa960335146752061359474400.png?w=1024)\n\nMatt asked to be monitored. So I created SafeCheck.\n\nA structure. From nothing. For someone dangerous. Because no one else would.\n\nDaily written reflections. Triggers and boundaries. Confession vaults. Behavioural logs.\n\nHe followed it. Religiously.\n\nNot because it made him better. Because it made him feel contained.\n\nAnd I wasn’t trained. I wasn’t protected.\n\nBut I understood the spiral. So I became the state.\n\n---\n\n## When the Systems Collapse\n\nChris and Matt both self-disclosed risk. Repeatedly. In detail. In writing.\n\nIn the UK, there’s no mechanism for self-disclosed risk without conviction. In Australia, same story. Exposure groups weren’t equipped. Police shrugged. No welfare checks. No escalation. Just silence.\n\nThey confessed. And were ignored.\n\nNot because they hid. Because there was no system built to catch them.\n\nSo they spiralled harder. Until they reached someone who answered.\n\nMe.\n\n---\n\n## Survivor-Led Doesn’t Mean Survivor-Resourced\n\nPeople call this survivor-led like it's empowerment.\n\nBut here’s what it actually means:\n\nYou hold the confession. You manage the risk. You build the structure. You carry the emotional fallout.\n\nAnd when you burn out? There’s no backup.\n\nNo protection. No institutional support. No hotline.\n\nJust you.\n\nWith the predator’s secrets in your inbox. And a nervous system too wrecked to sleep.\n\n---\n\n## When Exposure Becomes the Addiction\n\nAt first, their confessions looked like redemption. But it wasn’t healing. It was ritual.\n\nConfess. Spiral. Submit. Backpedal. Repeat.\n\nChris was subtle. Matt was explicit.\n\nMatt said he felt safer when watched. Exposure became his sedation. He called me his lifeline. Asked to be punished. For shame. \n\nThey weren’t seeking justice. They were addicted to the spiral.\n\nAnd exposure became the reward.\n\n---\n\n## The Final Collapse: When We Stop Holding Them\n\nWhen I walked away, there was no handoff.\n\nMatt spiralled. Again. Harder.\n\nMore confessions. More pressure. More collapse.\n\nBecause exposure was never a system. It was me.\n\nAnd when I stopped? The spiral didn’t end. It accelerated.\n\n---\n\n## We Were the System. We Broke. Now Build One.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_00000000294c6246a5a8396c1703d89b281291704321304737223930.jpg?w=1024)\n\nThere is no structure for the predator who wants to be stopped. No middle ground between confession and conviction.\n\nSo they come to us. And we break trying to hold them.\n\nWhat we need is clear:\n\n- A neutral self-referral pathway\n\n- A safeguarding bridge for self-disclosed risk\n\n- Survivor-informed containment models\n\n- Real protection for those holding the line\n\nBecause predators are evolving. And the state is not.\n\nAnd unless something real is built, we will keep catching what no system wants to hold.\n\n---\n\n**The Predator Paradox ends here — but the consequences don’t.**\n\nThis was never journalism. It was emergency containment. Built by a survivor. On trauma reflex.\n\nIt worked. Briefly.\n\nBut that’s not a success.

One Catholic school. Nearly two decades of abuse.**\n\n©️ **By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files**\n\n---\n\nSt Anne's Catholic School and Sixth Form College in Southampton has become the focus of Hampshire Police Operation Stonecrop — an investigation into multiple allegations of sexual abuse by staff in positions of trust, spanning cases from 2006 to 2022.\n\nThis is not one rogue adult who slipped through the cracks.\n\nThis is a pattern, repeated across years, across different staff members, across multiple victims that forces the question institutions work hardest to avoid:\n\n**How many people saw the warning signs, and chose to do nothing?**\n\n---\n\n## The Timeline Nobody Connected\n\n### 2006: Allegations involving a future headteacher\n\nIn December 2024, Hampshire Police announced charges against **James Edwin Rouse**, former headteacher of St Anne's, relating to alleged child sexual abuse from 2006.\n\nThe charge: sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.\n\nThis is one of the clearest legal definitions of institutional abuse.. adult power, child vulnerability, and the access the institution provided.\n\nA trial concluded with a hung jury. No verdict was reached.\n\n### 2014–2019: Convicted — abuse on school premises\n\nIn October 2025, **Leo Norman**, former English and Media teacher, was jailed for 14 months after pleading guilty to three counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.\n\n**The offending included sexual touching on school premises. In his office.**\n\nPolice reports state Norman paid his victims \"extra attention,\" complimented them, and took an interest in their personal lives to build trust before touching them sexually and inappropriately.\n\nVictims told the court they were left feeling confused and uncomfortable. One said she was made to feel like it was her fault he was attracted to her.\n\n**This didn't happen in some hidden \"other world.\" It happened inside the place children are told is safe during the routines of school life.**\n\n### 2021–2022: Recent allegations, same institution\n\nIn April 2025, Hampshire Police announced that **Paul Davis**, a former teacher, was charged with three counts of sexual activity with a girl under 16, alleged to have taken place in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThat timeline matters because it kills the comfortable myth that this is only \"historic\" abuse.\n\n**It shows continuity.**\n\n### December 2025: Another conviction\n\nOn 3 December 2025, the Crown Prosecution Service announced the conviction of **Edward Waller**, a former teacher, for sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court.\n\nThe court heard Waller groomed a vulnerable 16-17 year old student, sent increasingly sexual messages, and invited her to his home where he had sex with her. He was 46 at the time.\n\n**Again: position of trust. Again: an adult placed near children precisely because they were meant to protect them.**\n\n---\n\n## The Question Nobody Is Forcing the Institution to Answer\n\nWhen multiple staff members are investigated, charged, or convicted across different time periods, the issue is no longer just \"who did it.\"\n\nIt becomes:\n\n- Who noticed grooming patterns and dismissed them as \"favouritism\"?\n\n- Who heard rumours and treated them as schoolyard drama?\n\n- Who received disclosures and decided it was \"too complicated\"?\n\n- Who prioritised reputation management over safeguarding escalation?\n\n**Because safeguarding failure rarely looks like a villain twirling a moustache.**\n\nMost of the time, it looks like ordinary professionals choosing the path of least resistance, until the harm becomes undeniable.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters Nationally — Right Now\n\nThe UK government just announced the creation of a Child Protection Authority, designed to fix \"persistent systemic failures\" in safeguarding.\n\nThe stated problems: fragmented communication, agencies working in silos, failure to learn from serious case reviews.\n\n**But cases like St Anne's expose something deeper.**\n\nInstitutions can appear functional even high-performing in inspections, while serious abuse occurs within their walls.\n\nAnd when the pattern repeats across years, it's no longer credible to treat each case as isolated.\n\n**St Anne's looked functional. Inside, multiple teachers were exploiting children for nearly two decades.**\n\n---\n\n## What This Represents\n\nOne school.\n\nFour staff members accused or convicted.\n\nA police operation.\n\nCases spanning 2006 to 2022.\n\nWhether the wider institutional response was negligence, denial, fear, or reputation-protection, **the outcome is the same: children were placed near adults who exploited the access the institution provided.**\n\n---\n\n## The Questions That Need Answers\n\nIf this investigation is to mean anything beyond documentation, these questions must be asked:\n\n- What safeguarding reports, audits, or external reviews exist connected to Operation Stonecrop?\n\n- What did the school report to the Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO), and when?\n\n- How were staff concerns handled internally — whistleblowing policy, HR escalation, safeguarding thresholds?\n\n- Were there patterns in victim profiles that should have triggered earlier intervention?\n\n- What did the diocese or academy trust know, and what action did they take?\n\n**These aren't rhetorical questions.**\n\nThey're the questions the institution is hoping nobody asks consistently enough to demand answers.\n\nI'm asking.\n\n---\n\n**Sophie Lewis | NUJ-Accredited Investigative Journalist**\n**The Grooming Files**\n\n*This is an ongoing investigation.

Character evidence carries more weight for female defendants**\n\nWhen a female teacher has an \"unblemished career,\" this is treated as significant mitigation.\n\nWhen a male teacher has an \"unblemished career,\" this is treated as evidence of concealment: \"He maintained a respectable front while abusing children.\"\n\n**Same fact. Different interpretation.**\n\n---\n\n**2. Victimisation narratives**\n\nFemale offenders are more frequently permitted to present themselves as victims:\n\n- Of isolation\n\n- Of mental health struggles\n\n- Of the victim's \"pursuit\"\n\n- Of circumstances\n\nMale offenders presenting similar narratives are typically rejected: \"You are the adult. You held the power. You are responsible.\"\n\n**Same defence. Different reception.**\n\n---\n\n**3. The \"relationship\" framing**\n\nFemale offenders' abuse is more frequently described as a \"relationship\" that \"developed\" or they \"fell into.\"\n\nMale offenders' abuse is described as predation, grooming, exploitation.\n\n**Language matters.**\n\nWhen abuse is framed as a relationship, it:\n\n- Implies mutuality\n\n- Suggests the victim had agency\n\n- Minimises the power differential\n\n- Reduces perceived culpability\n\n---\n\n## THE PEARL APPEAL: A CASE STUDY\n\nIn July 2025, Catherine Pearl appealed parts of her Sexual Harm Prevention Order.\n\n**The Court of Appeal found:**\n\nCertain restrictions in the original SHPO were \"unnecessary and disproportionate.\"\n\nSpecifically, restrictions on internet capable devices and contact with children were replaced with a narrower prohibition: Pearl is banned from seeking or holding any position of authority or care of children until January 2035.\n\n**What this reveals:**\n\nEven after conviction for sexually abusing a child in her care over years, the legal system calibrated her restrictions to be less intrusive.\n\n**The question:**\n\nWould a male deputy head convicted of sexually abusing a student over years receive the same consideration?\n\nOr would the restrictions be upheld as entirely proportionate given the offending?\n\n---\n\n## PREGNANCY AS AN AGGRAVATING FACTOR\n\nRebecca Joynes became pregnant by Boy B.\n\n**This should be an aggravating factor:**\n\n- Evidence of ongoing sexual contact\n\n- Physical evidence of the abuse\n\n- Additional trauma for the victim (his child exists as permanent evidence of his victimisation)\n\n- Demonstrates complete disregard for consequences\n\n**But pregnancy can also invoke sympathy:**\n\n\"She's going to be a mother\"\n\"The child is innocent\"\n\"Custody will be harder for her\"\n\n**The protective framing operates even here.**\n\nPregnancy by a victim should aggravate sentencing.\n\nIn some cases, it appears to mitigate it.\n\n---\n\n## THE BAIL OFFENDING AGGRAVATION\n\nJoynes's offending while on bail for the first set of offences is a clear aggravating factor.\n\n**It demonstrates:**\n\n- Continued predatory behaviour despite arrest\n\n- Disregard for legal process\n\n- Inability to control behaviour\n\n- High risk of reoffending\n\n**This appropriately contributed to her 6.5 year sentence.**\n\n**But the question remains:**\n\nWould a male teacher who continued offending while on bail for child sexual abuse receive only 6.5 years?\n\nOr would that bail breach be treated as evidence of dangerous persistent predation warranting significantly longer custody?\n\n---\n\n## WHAT SENTENCING DATA SHOULD SHOW\n\n**If sentencing is gender neutral, we should see:**\n\n- Comparable sentences for comparable offending\n\n- Similar weight given to aggravating factors\n\n- Similar weight given to mitigating factors\n\n- Similar language in sentencing remarks\n\n**If sentencing reflects protective framing, we see:**\n\n- Lower sentences for female offenders\n\n- Greater weight to mitigation for female offenders\n\n- Different language framing female offending as aberration\n\n- Different language framing male offending as predation\n\n**Preliminary review suggests the latter.**\n\n**But this requires rigorous empirical analysis.**\n\n---\n\n## THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES PROBLEM\n\n**UK sentencing guidelines for sexual offences are gender neutral in text.**\n\n**They focus on:**\n\n- Harm to victim\n\n- Culpability of offender\n\n- Aggravating factors\n\n- Mitigating factors\n\n**But guidelines are applied by humans.**\n\n**And humans carry protective framing.**\n\n---\n\n### **How Protective Framing Infiltrates Sentencing:**\n\n**At the harm assessment stage:**\n\nCourts may perceive male victims as less harmed:\n\n- \"He's not traumatised the way a girl would be\"\n\n- \"Boys are more resilient\"\n\n- \"It's different for boys\"\n\n**At the culpability assessment stage:**\n\nCourts may perceive female offenders as less culpable:\n\n- \"She fell into this\"\n\n- \"She was vulnerable herself\"\n\n- \"This is out of character\"\n\n**At the aggravation assessment stage:**\n\nCourts may weigh aggravating factors differently:\n\n- Abuse of trust treated as less serious when perpetrator is female\n\n- Grooming behaviours framed as \"developing relationship\"\n\n- Power differential minimised\n\n**At the mitigation assessment stage:**\n\nCourts may give more weight to mitigation for female offenders:\n\n- Mental health\n\n- Isolation\n\n- Previous good character\n\n- Impact of custody on children\n\n---\n\n## THE INSTITUTIONAL SENTENCING PROBLEM\n\nPearl was deputy head teacher.\n\n**This should aggravate her sentence:**\n\n- Higher position of authority\n\n- Greater breach of trust\n\n- Specific safeguarding responsibilities\n\n- Institutional power to conceal abuse\n\n**But it may have operated differently:**\n\nHer senior position, professional reputation, and \"unblemished career\" may have been treated as mitigating factors:\n\n\"She's thrown away a distinguished career\"\n\"She held a position of respect\"\n\"This is so out of character for someone of her standing\"\n\n**The same institutional authority that facilitated her abuse becomes evidence of how much she has to lose.**\n\n**This is protective framing in judicial reasoning.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT THE VICTIMS EXPERIENCE\n\n### **When Sentences Are Lower:**\n\nFor victims of female perpetrators who receive lighter sentences than comparable male offenders:\n\n**The message received is:**\n\n- \"What happened to you was less serious\"\n\n- \"Your abuser is less dangerous\"\n\n- \"The system doesn't view this the same way\"\n\n**This affects:**\n\n- Willingness to report\n\n- Participation in prosecution\n\n- Recovery process\n\n- Trust in justice system\n\n---\n\n### **When Abuse Is Reframed:**\n\nWhen courts describe abuse as a \"relationship\" or suggest the victim \"pursued\" the adult:\n\n**The message is:**\n\n- \"You had agency in this\"\n\n- \"This wasn't really abuse\"\n\n- \"You're partly responsible\"\n\n**For child victims, this is revictimisation.**\n\n---\n\n## THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION PROBLEM\n\n**Sentencing shapes public understanding of harm.**\n\n**When we see:**\n\n- Male teacher: 12+ years for sexual abuse of student\n\n- Female teacher: 2-6 years for sexual abuse of student\n\n**The public learns:**\n\n- Female perpetrated abuse is less serious\n\n- Male victims are harmed less\n\n- Women who abuse children deserve more sympathy\n\n**This reinforces:**\n\n- Underreporting by male victims\n\n- Protective framing in institutions\n\n- Lighter sentences in future cases\n\n**It's a self-reinforcing cycle.**\n\n---\n\n## THE RESEARCH QUESTION\n\n**What we need:**\n\nSystematic analysis of sentencing in child sexual abuse cases comparing:\n\n- Male vs female perpetrators\n\n- Controlling for:\n\n- Number of victims\n\n- Age of victims\n\n- Duration of abuse\n\n- Aggravating factors\n\n- Mitigating factors\n\n- Guilty plea vs trial\n\n**This would reveal:**\n\n- Whether a sentencing gap exists\n\n- How large it is\n\n- What factors explain it\n\n- Whether it's justified by case differences or reflects bias\n\n**Until we have this data, we're working from:**\n\n- Individual case observations\n\n- Anecdotal patterns\n\n- Preliminary reviews\n\n**But the pattern is visible enough to warrant investigation.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT EQUAL SENTENCING WOULD LOOK LIKE\n\n**Equal sentencing doesn't mean:**\n\n- Identical sentences for all offenders\n\n- Ignoring individual case factors\n\n- Mechanical application of guidelines\n\n**It means:**\n\n- Comparable weight to comparable aggravating factors\n\n- Comparable weight to comparable mitigating factors\n\n- Gender neutral language in sentencing remarks\n\n- Focus on harm to victim, not gender of perpetrator\n\n- Recognition that all child sexual abuse is serious\n\n---\n\n## THE CATHERINE PEARL QUESTION\n\n**2 years 4 months for:**\n\n- Deputy head teacher\n\n- Sexual abuse of student in her care\n\n- Abuse over \"years\"\n\n- Committed in school setting\n\n- Terrible impact on victim\n\n**Is this sentence proportionate to the harm?**\n\n**Or does it reflect protective framing?**\n\nThe Court of Appeal confirmed the sentencing judge \"was plainly right to take a very serious view\" of the offending.\n\n**But 2 years 4 months for years of abuse by a deputy head teacher with safeguarding responsibilities?**\n\n**The question stands.**\n\n---\n\n## THE REBECCA JOYNES QUESTION\n\n**6.5 years for:**\n\n- Teacher\n\n- Two 15 year old victims\n\n- Sexual intercourse with both\n\n- £345 gift (material grooming)\n\n- Overnight stay at her flat\n\n- Continued offending while on bail\n\n- Became pregnant by second victim\n\n**Is this sentence proportionate to the harm?**\n\n**Or does it also reflect protective framing?**\n\nBecause while 6.5 years is significantly more than Pearl's sentence, the question remains:\n\n**Would a male teacher who:**\n\n- Sexually abused two 15 year old students\n\n- Bought them expensive gifts\n\n- Took them to his flat\n\n- Got one pregnant\n\n- Continued offending while on bail\n\n**…receive only 6.5 years?**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT COMES NEXT\n\nIn **Part 5**, we'll examine prevention: what Catherine Pearl and Rebecca Joynes teach us about recognition, response, and building safeguarding frameworks that protect all children regardless of perpetrator gender.\n\nWe'll address:\n\n- Warning signs we missed\n\n- Institutional failures\n\n- How to break the cycle of invisibility\n\n- What gender neutral safeguarding actually looks like\n\n- How to support victims regardless of perpetrator gender\n\n**The sentencing gap isn't just about fairness to defendants.**\n\n**It's about protection for potential victims.**\n\n**Because when sentences are lower, the message is clear:**\n\n**This abuse is less serious.**\n\n**And predators hear that message too.**\n\n---\n\n## SOURCES & VERIFICATION\n\nAll facts in this article are

society still refuses to believe that women can sexually abuse — and what it’s costing survivors.*\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000320c6246a61203bc93e1ad35281295580508470115466677.jpg?w=1024)\n\n---\n\n## We Don’t Want to Believe It\n\nThere’s a collective discomfort when the topic of female abusers comes up.\nEven among survivor communities, it’s often met with silence, confusion, or outright dismissal.\n\n“She wouldn’t do that.”\n“Mothers don’t do that.”\n“He probably enjoyed it.”\n“She was probably just mentally unwell.”\n\nBut the truth is simple:\n**Women can and do sexually abuse children.**\nAnd our refusal to talk about it is leaving survivors completely alone in their truth.\n\n---\n\n## Challenging the Gender Myth\n\nSexual abuse is often framed as a male-on-female crime.\nThat’s because statistically, most offenders *are* male but not all.\nAnd when women offend, the fallout is uniquely brutal.. because **they’re not seen as capable** of that kind of harm.\n\nThis is especially true when:\n\n- The child is male\n\n- The woman is a mother or carer\n\n- The woman is attractive, respected, or in a position of trust (like a teacher or nurse)\n\nRather than outrage, female offenders often trigger cognitive dissonance:\nPeople literally *can’t believe it*, so they don’t.\n\n---\n\n## The Boy Who Wasn’t Believed\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000002074620aaf7c954585ecd9ab4882524427007153671.png?w=1024)\n\nWhen young boys are sexually abused by women, they’re often told they should feel “lucky.”\nThat it’s a “rite of passage.”\nThat they should have wanted it.\n\nThis is not just harmful.\nIt’s a form of secondary abuse.\n\nThe truth is:\n\n- Boys can be groomed, manipulated, and violated just as deeply as girls\n\n- They may experience confusion, shame, arousal, and fear — all at once\n\n- Many suppress their experiences until adulthood, if they speak at all\n\nAnd when they do come forward, they often find there’s **no script for their story.**\nNo space where they’re taken seriously. No protection from the jokes and the disbelief.\n\n---\n\n## When the Abuser Is “Mum”\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000000afc6243b97fa28b350fd51e7375219180378369269.png?w=1024)\n\nPerhaps the most taboo subject of all: **maternal sexual abuse.**\n\nIt goes against every cultural script we have.\nThe mother is meant to be a protector.\nBut some survivors know the pain of being violated by the very person who was supposed to keep them safe.\n\nThis is rarely talked about. Rarely researched. Rarely believed.\n\nAnd for those who lived it, the silence can be worse than the abuse itself.\n\n---\n\n## Institutional Blindness\n\nThe disbelief around female offenders doesn’t just happen in families, it happens across the system.\n\n- **Social workers** may miss signs if the accused is a mother or female teacher\n\n- **Police officers** may hesitate to take reports seriously from male victims\n\n- **Courts** may hand down lighter sentences to women\n\n- **Media** often romanticises cases — especially when it involves an adult female and a teenage boy\n\nThis bias doesn’t just fail victims. It emboldens offenders.\n\nBecause if society doesn’t see you as a threat, you’re much harder to stop.\n\n---\n\n## Survivors Are Left Without Language\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000092e8620ab3eb779c9334ec0a8806524644430323899.png?w=1024)\n\nFor many victims of female abusers, there’s no obvious label to reach for.\nEspecially when the abuse wasn’t violent, but emotional, manipulative, or disguised as affection.\n\nHow do you tell someone that the woman who raised you… also touched you?\n\nThat the teacher who encouraged you… crossed a line?\n\nThat the carer who bathed you… didn’t stop?\n\nWithout a social script to lean on, **survivors of female offenders are often left believing it was their fault.**\nOr that it “wasn’t abuse.”\nOr that it doesn’t count.\n\nIt *does* count. It always has. We just haven’t made enough room for it in our conversations, or our systems.\n\n---\n\n## What Needs to Change\n\nEnding the silence around female offenders means we have to do what society has failed to do for decades:\n\n**Believe survivors.**\n**Expand our definitions.**\n**Stop romanticising what is actually abuse.**\n\nWe need:\n\n- More education that clearly states women can be abusers\n\n- Survivor-informed training for professionals working with children\n\n- Media responsibility when reporting on female offenders\n\n- Resources and peer support for male and female survivors of female abuse\n\n- Clearer safeguarding guidelines that apply regardless of gender\n\n---\n\n### The silence around female sexual abuse is not accidental.\nIt’s been shaped by centuries of gender stereotypes, cultural denial, and institutional blind spots.\n\nBut silence doesn’t protect anyone, it isolates survivors and shields perpetrators.\n\nThe truth is painful.\nBut the silence is lethal.\n\nAnd it’s time we broke it.\n\n---\n\n**This is Part 3 of the ‘What We’re Still Not Talking About’ series.**\nRead the flagship article here:[What We're Still Not Talking About ](http://thegroomingfiles.com/2025/05/10/what-were-still-not-talking-about/)🤫\n\n---","src/content/articles/the-silence-around-female-offenders.md","201e4adbf637f53a",{"html":5735,"metadata":5736},"\u003Cp>© By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"why-society-still-refuses-to-believe-that-women-can-sexually-abuse--and-what-its-costing-survivors\">\u003Cem>Why society still refuses to believe that women can sexually abuse — and what it’s costing survivors.\u003C/em>\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000320c6246a61203bc93e1ad35281295580508470115466677.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"we-dont-want-to-believe-it\">We Don’t Want to Believe It\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There’s a collective discomfort when the topic of female abusers comes up.\nEven among survivor communities, it’s often met with silence, confusion, or outright dismissal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“She wouldn’t do that.”\n“Mothers don’t do that.”\n“He probably enjoyed it.”\n“She was probably just mentally unwell.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But the truth is simple:\n\u003Cstrong>Women can and do sexually abuse children.\u003C/strong>\nAnd our refusal to talk about it is leaving survivors completely alone in their truth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"challenging-the-gender-myth\">Challenging the Gender Myth\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Sexual abuse is often framed as a male-on-female crime.\nThat’s because statistically, most offenders \u003Cem>are\u003C/em> male but not all.\nAnd when women offend, the fallout is uniquely brutal.. because \u003Cstrong>they’re not seen as capable\u003C/strong> of that kind of harm.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is especially true when:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>The child is male\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>The woman is a mother or carer\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>The woman is attractive, respected, or in a position of trust (like a teacher or nurse)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Rather than outrage, female offenders often trigger cognitive dissonance:\nPeople literally \u003Cem>can’t believe it\u003C/em>, so they don’t.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-boy-who-wasnt-believed\">The Boy Who Wasn’t Believed\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000002074620aaf7c954585ecd9ab4882524427007153671.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When young boys are sexually abused by women, they’re often told they should feel “lucky.”\nThat it’s a “rite of passage.”\nThat they should have wanted it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is not just harmful.\nIt’s a form of secondary abuse.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The truth is:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Boys can be groomed, manipulated, and violated just as deeply as girls\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>They may experience confusion, shame, arousal, and fear — all at once\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Many suppress their experiences until adulthood, if they speak at all\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>And when they do come forward, they often find there’s \u003Cstrong>no script for their story.\u003C/strong>\nNo space where they’re taken seriously.

Not just in headlines, or courtrooms, or safeguarding policies — but in living rooms, group chats, and even the minds of the victims themselves.\n\nToo often, boys and men who have experienced grooming are left with no name for what happened. They aren't seen as vulnerable. They're not offered help. They aren't believed. Or worse — they're told it wasn't abuse at all.\n\nThis silence is not accidental. It's cultural. It's institutional. And it's deeply damaging.\n\n---\n\n## **Why Don't We Talk About It?**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000a17c620a837a7ea11c0bab5f7429241438255674177.png?w=1024)\n\nFrom a young age, boys are taught to \"man up.\" They're told to be strong, unemotional, in control. If a young boy is targeted by an older woman, it's framed as a \"score.\" If he's groomed by an older man, it's taboo, unspoken, or blamed on him entirely.\n\nMasculinity is often weaponised against male survivors. It becomes a barrier that stops them from recognising they've been abused, let alone reaching out for support. And when they do come forward, they're too often met with disbelief, ridicule, or outright dismissal.\n\nBut grooming doesn't care about gender. It targets vulnerability, not identity. And boys are not immune.\n\n---\n\n## **The Hidden Scale of Abuse**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000002074620aaf7c954585ecd9ab27465593203840467.png?w=1024)\n\nAccording to the NSPCC, around 1 in 6 children in the UK have experienced some form of sexual abuse. While many associate grooming with girls, boys account for a significant proportion of victims. A report by the Children’s Commissioner revealed that in cases of child sexual abuse recorded by police, **more than 1 in 3 victims were male**.\n\nYet the vast majority of male survivors never disclose their abuse. A study by SurvivorsUK found that **only 10% of male victims ever report**. Many carry the trauma for decades, untreated and unspoken.\n\nThis isn’t just silence. It’s systemic neglect.\n\n---\n\n## **The Ways Boys Are Groomed**\n\nMale grooming can take many forms:\n\n- Online friendships that turn sexual\n\n- “Mentorships” with older figures that become coercive\n\n- Exploitation by older men or women under the guise of affection\n\n- Manipulation through gaming, sports, or peer pressure\n\nThese experiences are often dismissed because they don’t look like the stereotypical narrative of victimhood. But they carry just as much psychological weight — sometimes more, because the victim isn't even allowed to call it what it is.\n\nIn one UK case, a woman in her 30s was convicted after grooming and abusing a teenage boy for over a year. He thought it was a relationship. The media called it a “tryst.” This language matters. It hides the truth.\n\n---\n\n## **Why Society Ignores Boys**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000092e8620ab3eb779c9334ec0a2805608167795542468.png?w=1024)\n\nSociety still sees boys as tough, independent, and emotionally guarded. They're less likely to be viewed as victims, and more likely to be punished for behaviours that are actually symptoms of trauma.\n\nBoys acting out are often labelled as troublemakers rather than recognised as children in crisis. Teachers may miss the signs. Families may brush off red flags. And too often, male victims are left alone with their pain until it explodes or shuts them down.\n\nWe cannot protect boys if we do not first acknowledge that they, too, are targeted.\n\n---\n\n## **Systemic Failures**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000fe64620a96f7a36aad4360579147748423039405009.png?w=683)\n\nSafeguarding structures often overlook male victims. Schools may not flag the same behaviours in boys that they would in girls. Health services often lack male-specific trauma support. Police may not handle disclosures with the same seriousness.\n\nToo many abuse support charities are still structured around female victims — leaving male survivors with few culturally safe spaces to turn.\n\nIn 2021, a UK study on CSA (Child Sexual Abuse) support revealed that **over 75% of services were geared toward women and girls**, leaving men underrepresented and underserved.\n\nSome of the men who have shared their stories with us waited decades to speak. Many still haven't. Not because they don't want healing. But because they never saw themselves reflected in the conversations around grooming.\n\n---\n\n## **The Shame Runs Deep**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000c624620a911a29e071b11cd93640305329430032339.png?w=683)\n\nMale survivors often carry shame in silence. Some question their masculinity. Some internalise blame. Some wonder whether it was abuse at all — especially when the perpetrator was female.\n\nOthers are left in deep confusion when their abuser was male.\n\n> \n> *“For years I thought it was love,” one man told me. “For a long time, I believed I was gay. But now I realise — I was just a child. And he wasn't supposed to touch me.*”\n> \n> \n> \n\nThe emotional toll is heavy. Depression, substance use, isolation, and self-harm are all too common among men with unacknowledged trauma.\n\nSuicide rates among men in the UK remain significantly higher than women — and while there are many factors, untreated childhood trauma is a known contributor.\n\nBut here’s the truth: they were children. It was never their fault.\n\n---\n\n## **What Needs to Change**\n\n- **Belief** — We must believe boys when they say something happened. Even if it doesn’t fit the mould.\n\n- **Representation** — Campaigns, education, and services must include male victims.\n\n- **Language** — Let’s drop the jokes and double standards. Abuse is abuse.\n\n- **Safe Spaces** — Create and fund survivor spaces where men are not an afterthought.\n\n- **Education** — Teach children early that grooming affects everyone — and that coming forward is never weak.\n\n- **Media Responsibility** — Headlines must reflect reality, not sensationalism. Calling abuse a “tryst” or “affair” erases victims.\n\n---\n\n## **A Final Word to Survivors**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000003710620aa1d1faafed5646d64387269069422714561.png?w=683)\n\nIf you're a man who was groomed — by a woman, by a man, by someone who claimed to care for you — you are not alone.

confronting.\nIt refuses euphemism.\nIt doesn't allow distance.\n\nSo instead, softer language is used.\n\nAt risk.\nSexually active.\nExchanging sex.\nMaking unsafe choices.\n\nBut none of those phrases tell the truth.\n\nThere is no such thing as a child prostitute.\nThere are only children navigating adult worlds they were never meant to survive.\n\n---\n\n## Not All Are \"Sold\"\n\nWhen people imagine child prostitution, they often picture trafficking rings, handovers, envelopes of cash.\n\nSometimes that happens.\n\nBut often, it doesn't.\n\nMany children are not sold they are cornered.\n\nA sofa for the night.\nA hot meal.\nA lift.\nProtection from someone worse.\n\nSex becomes currency not because the child wants it, but because they have nothing else to trade.\n\nThat isn't choice.\nThat is survival under coercion.\n\nAnd survival rarely looks dignified.\n\n---\n\n## Some Never Learn Anything Else\n\nNot all children arrive at exploitation through force.\n\nSome arrive through familiarity.\n\nThey grow up in homes where:\n\nboundaries don't exist\nabuse is normal\naffection is conditional\nattention is sexualised\n\nBy the time they are noticed by professionals, the behaviour is already there.. learned, rehearsed, embedded.\n\nSo adults say:\n\n> \n> \"She keeps returning.\"\n> \"He seeks it out.\"\n> \"They won't engage with help.\"\n> \n> \n> \n\nWhat they mean is: This child learnt the rules of a broken world early and unlearning them is not instant.\n\n---\n\n## Control Doesn't Always Look Like Chains\n\nNot every exploited child is locked in a room.\n\nSome are locked into belief.\n\nThat they are loved\nThat this is normal\nThat leaving means danger\nThat compliance equals safety\n\nGrooming doesn't always shout.\nSometimes it whispers reassurance.\n\nAnd once attachment forms, the grip tightens.. not through fear alone, but through dependency.\n\n---\n\n## When the System Steps Back\n\nThis is where the story becomes uncomfortable.\n\nBecause in many cases, exploitation doesn't begin with an offender.\nIt begins with absence.\n\nA placement that breaks down.\nSupport that is withdrawn.\nA child labelled \"difficult\".\nRisk assessments that replace protection.\n\n**And the, once professionals step back offenders step in.**\n\nOnce a child is framed as risky rather than at risk, intervention weakens.\n\nAnd exploitation fills the gap left behind.\n\nNot because the child chose it but because nothing else was left standing.\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/file_00000000106c71f58322e158660e400e1014621396413217223.png?w=1024)\n\n## Behaviour Is Not Consent\n\nChildren adapt.\n\nThey learn what works. They learn how to survive. They learn how to get through the night.\n\nSometimes that looks like confidence. Sometimes it looks like sexual bravado. Sometimes it looks like control.\n\nBut adaptation is not consent.\n\nAnd behaviour shaped by trauma is not choice.\n\n---\n\n## Why Language Matters\n\nCalling a child a prostitute does something dangerous.\n\nIt shifts responsibility. It suggests agency where none exists.

Foster care, children’s homes, adoption agencies, all now carry price tags.\n\nIn 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) raised concerns about **excessive profits** made by providers of children’s social care. Some homes charge local councils **over £7,000 per week** per child.\n\nIncentives are backwards:\n\n- Reunification = lost revenue.\n\n- Permanent removal = long-term placement fees.\n\nChildren become units.

How many are trafficked, abused, or criminally exploited?\n\nWe don’t know. Because the system doesn’t track the answers.\n\nThe government and media use phrases like \"absconding\" or \"runaway.\" But when vulnerable children are taken from their homes, placed with strangers, then disappear under state watch, that is **institutional failure**.

Not with purpose. Not with mindfulness. Just survival. My body was functioning, but my soul had long since left the room.\n\nI wasn’t searching for spirituality. I wasn’t looking for depth. I was chasing escape.\n\nBack then, anything that promised to lift the weight, even for an hour, was welcome. I didn’t want to feel better. I just didn’t want to feel *anything*. Sad, numb, burnt out, and circling the same internal pit with no language for what I was really carrying.\n\nI didn’t find psychedelics through some divine synchronicity. They came the same way most things did in that chapter of my life, through someone with a bag, a text, a weekend, and no plan.\n\n---\n\n## DMT: The First Knock\n\nIt started with DMT. We bought a gram off someone. No idea what we were doing. Built a makeshift bong. Burnt half of it trying to get a high. Nothing happened. We laughed. Wrote it off. Thought we’d been ripped off.\n\nThat same night, another friend messaged us. Microdots. 4-AcO-DMT. I had no idea what that was either, but at that point, the words didn’t matter. We said yes.\n\nI took it. Waited. Nothing. Went to bed.\n\n**Then the universe split open.**\n\nI don’t even remember the transition. I just remember *being somewhere else*. Colours, patterns, emotions flooding through me like I’d cracked through the veil of my own reality. And I wasn’t scared. I was fascinated. For the first time in what felt like forever, I was *feeling something*. It didn’t feel like a trip. It felt like a visitation. I saw myself. The girl I’d left behind. And I wanted more.\n\nI didn’t know then that not all trips take you upward.\n\nSome drag you underground.\n\n---\n\n## Ego Death\n\nThe next time, we learned how to smoke DMT properly. The first breakthrough was stunning. The visuals were intense. The room melted. My body dissolved. I felt light, floaty, almost transcendent.\n\nSo I did it again.\n\nThat second breakthrough changed everything.\n\nI didn’t come back the same.\n\nI saw Jesus. I’m not religious. But that’s what I saw, or what I thought I saw. Some presence. Something cosmic. I died. Not metaphorically. Not poetically. I *died*. Or I thought I did.\n\nI pissed myself. I cried. I vomited. I shook. I lost every sense of time, body, place, and identity.\n\nThere was no language for what was happening. There still isn’t. People call it ego death. All I knew is I was being unravelled from the inside out.\n\nIt didn’t feel enlightening. It felt like being torn apart.\n\nAnd when I came back, I was quieter. Not because I was peaceful, but because I didn’t know if I’d made it back whole.\n\n---\n\n## The Fracture\n\nIn the days that followed, I felt disconnected. Like my soul hadn’t caught up with my body. I floated. I dissociated. I’d sit in rooms and not feel real. I’d talk and not hear myself. I was untethered.\n\nBut the chase was still in me.\n\nWe got more 4-AcO. I took it again but this time, I was around the wrong person. The energy was off. My gut knew. Psychedelics don’t lie. They don’t let you pretend.\n\nThat trip was the worst I’ve ever had. To this day.\n\nIt wasn’t just a bad trip. It was *psychotic*. I spiralled. I thought Walt Disney had sent me on a mission to save the world. I believed I’d lived through thousands of years. I lost all touch with reality. Nothing around me felt safe. I was paranoid. Delirious. Unhinged.\n\nIt lasted hours, but felt like lifetimes. I was stuck in some eternal loop, and every time I thought it was ending, it twisted into something worse.\n\nI came out shattered. No insight. No growth. Just broken.\n\nI didn't touch psychedelics again for a long time after that.\n\n---\n\n## The Turning\n\nBut something started to shift, slowly, underneath it all.\n\nThe drugs weren’t an escape anymore. They’d stopped being fun. They’d stopped being chaotic distractions. They were *mirrors*. Brutal ones.\n\nI began to see the patterns. The people I surrounded myself with. The energy I absorbed. The grief I kept swallowing. The parts of me I was still hiding from.\n\nAnd for the first time, I wasn’t chasing highs. I was chasing *truth*.\n\n---\n\n## Mushrooms: The Return to Earth\n\nThe next trip was different. Mushrooms. And this time, I wasn’t alone.\n\nI took them with someone I trust more than anyone in the world. And in that trust, I found a softness I didn’t know I needed.\n\nThat trip was gentle. Kind. Honest.\n\nIt didn’t knock me down. It held me. It didn’t blast open portals. It opened my heart.\n\nI cried in a way I hadn’t before, not from confusion or collapse, but from relief. I breathed deeper. I spoke things I’d never dared say. I met myself again. And I didn’t run.\n\nThat was the first trip that truly *healed*. Because I was finally *ready* to feel it.\n\n---\n\n## What They Gave Me\n\nPsychedelics didn’t fix me. They didn’t hand me peace. They didn’t erase my trauma.\n\nThey stripped me raw. They dismantled the illusions I built to survive. They dragged the silence into the light.\n\nThey showed me:\n\n- the shame I didn’t name\n\n- the rage I swallowed\n\n- the child inside me still waiting to be saved\n\n- the fear I carried like skin\n\nThey showed me my shadow and made me look her in the eyes.\n\nAnd after the storms… came stillness. Not because everything was okay. But because *I had finally stopped running*.\n\n---\n\n## Final Truth\n\nPsychedelics didn’t save me. But they introduced me to the version of myself that could.\n\nThey humbled me. They burned me. They brought me to the edge.\n\nAnd eventually, they showed me how to walk back. Not as who I was. But as who I’d always been underneath the noise.\n\nThis isn’t an advert. This isn’t advice. This is just my truth.\n\nSometimes you trip for fun. Sometimes you trip for healing. And sometimes, the trip breaks you open so wide that you finally remember who you were before the world told you to hide.\n\n🌌 Soph x","src/content/articles/the-trip-that-broke-me-and-put-me-back-together.md","68840e017f86b22c",{"html":5988,"metadata":5989},"\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files | Shadowborn Series\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/file_00000000d19461f4a862ef66472f94ab7353026868378412155.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>Before I ever thought of healing, I was just trying to get through the day.

It’s the raw truth of a woman who reported her childhood abuse to South Wales Police — and was left traumatised not just by her abuser, but by the very system meant to protect her.\n> \n> \n> \n\nWhat started as a brave step forward — disclosing years of child sexual abuse and helping bring a known, violent man to court — quickly spiralled into something unimaginable. Over the next few years, she would endure a deeply flawed police investigation, multiple failed trials, and a complete absence of victim safeguarding. But worse still, she would find herself on the receiving end of police violence, arrest, humiliation, and silencing.\n\nDespite securing a civil settlement and public apology from South Wales Police after one unlawful arrest, it happened again. Officers from the same station returned. The fear, the trauma, and the physical assault were repeated — this time while she begged an ambulance service to help her.\n\nNow, she’s battling not only the trauma of her past but also a court case she believes is designed to shut her up. Her mental and physical health have deteriorated. She’s terrified — and she’s running out of strength.\n\nThis is her story.\n\n---\n\n## **The Report and the Trial That Was Never Meant to Succeed**\n\nThe woman’s ordeal with South Wales Police began when she reported historical child sexual abuse. The alleged perpetrator, Robert Witchell, was eventually charged with **nine counts of rape of a child** — a significant and serious case. But even as charges were brought, it was already clear the investigation had deep flaws.\n\nSouth Wales Police never arrested Witchell. They failed to seize his electronic devices or gather critical evidence. There were missed opportunities throughout the investigation — moments that could have strengthened the case, protected the survivor, and potentially saved others. But those moments were lost.\n\nMeanwhile, they did seize *her* devices — a move she found both confusing and traumatising, especially given the lack of similar action against the man accused of harming her.\n\nThree trials were brought forward. The first ended early when the jury was discharged. The second and third both resulted in partial acquittals and hung juries. After that, the CPS chose not to proceed. Her Independent Sexual Violence Advocate (ISVA), who had supported survivors through many trials, described the entire legal process as “the most shambolic” she’d ever witnessed.\n\nDespite the gravity of the charges, there were **no safeguarding orders** put in place for her protection. No Sexual Risk Order. No structured monitoring. No risk management. She was left exposed — and the man she had accused, free.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17443749204052886762994789172559.jpg?w=768)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17443749226704295796994505076911.jpg?w=768)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17443749246665489452760124073994.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17443749276657676127720397566340.jpg?w=860)\n\n---\n\n## **The First Arrest – 2:30AM, No Warning, No Dignity**\n\nWhile the man she accused was never arrested, she was.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, around 2:30AM, **three police officers from Maesteg Station** — **PC Lauren Evans, PC Ben Griffiths, and PC Simon Smith** — turned up at her home. She was not considered a threat, had no violent record, and the alleged offence was a minor, summary-only matter. Yet what followed was a full-force response that left her traumatised.\n\nShe describes being dragged from her home and **exposed in front of male officers**, her body left uncovered during the arrest. She remembers the fear, the shock, and the deep humiliation — emotions that haven’t faded since.\n\nThe charge she faced at the time was eventually dropped. She was **never found guilty** of any wrongdoing. But the experience left a mark that no apology could erase.\n\nAt a time when police had failed to arrest an accused child rapist, they used force against a vulnerable woman with no history of violence. And while no action was taken to secure his devices, **hers were seized.** To her, it felt like a message: **you are the one under scrutiny.**\n\nThe impact was devastating. She later admitted she didn’t want to be alive anymore. Still, somehow, she got through the trials. She waited for justice. But after the final case collapsed, she was told **no further trial would be pursued**.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_editor_output_image-1738005564-17443751412727411537730655559902.jpg?w=1024)\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_editor_output_image-2089103520-17443751564082478559437012075935.jpg?w=1024)\n\n---\n\n## **No Safeguards. No Communication. No Protection.**\n\nAfter the second trial ended without a verdict, that was it.\n\nThere was no retrial. No justice. And no safeguarding — not for her, and not for the public.\n\nDespite the severity of the charges against Robert Witchell, **no Sexual Risk Order** was put in place. No risk assessment was shared. No warning was issued to communities. The man she had accused — with a history of convictions, including for violence against partners — was allowed to return to daily life **with no restrictions at all.**\n\nMeanwhile, she was left alone. Terrified. Traumatised. And increasingly convinced that the system had abandoned her.\n\nSo she did what the police wouldn’t: she warned people. She posted Witchell’s name and location on local Facebook groups to **alert others** and keep children safe. Her intention wasn’t revenge — it was survival. She didn’t want anyone else to suffer what she had.\n\nBut South Wales Police didn’t see it that way.\n\nThey invited her to a **voluntary interview (VA)**. When she declined — out of fear, distrust, and mental exhaustion — she was **threatened with arrest for harassment**. For trying to protect others when the system failed to.\n\nAt the same time, she was pursuing legal action against the police for the first arrest. She eventually won. She received **a £40,000 civil settlement** and an official **apology**. On paper, it looked like progress.\n\nBut in her words:\n\n> \n> “The apology meant nothing. Because they came back again.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17443752112836082903049646117359.jpg?w=720)\n\n---\n\n## **The Second Assault – “They Were From the Same Station”**\n\nThe apology was barely dry when it happened again.\n\nOn **21st January 2024**, she says **four officers arrived at her home**. And just like the first time, **they were all from Maesteg Station** — the very same station as the officers who assaulted her before.\n\nTheir names:\n**PC Ruth Abbott, PS Rob Fisher, PC Wiston, and PC Rayner.**\n\nBy now, after everything she’d endured — from the botched investigation to the night-time arrest and the constant sense of being watched — she was traumatised, exhausted, and **terrified of South Wales Police**. So when they appeared at her door again, she panicked.\n\nShe told them to go away. She screamed. She shouted. She begged.\nInstead of leaving, **they began tampering with her door lock**, attempting to force entry.\n\nHer heart pounding, she did what anyone in fear would do — she called for help. **She phoned the ambulance service**, desperate for medical support as chest pain took hold. But by the time she was on the line, the officers had already forced their way in.\n\nShe says what followed was another violent takedown — a second assault in her own home. As she begged the ambulance operator for help, she was overwhelmed and physically restrained. In a final twist of cruelty, she says police **instructed the ambulance crew to stand down.**\n\nThere’s a recording of part of that call. It exists.\nIt captures her fear, her desperation, and her voice, cracking under the weight of it all.\n\nShe wasn’t a threat. She was a disabled, traumatised woman — being targeted, again.\n\n---\n\n## **A Charge, a Warrant, and a Broken System**\n\nAfter the second arrest, the outcome was bleak but unsurprising.\n\n**No Further Action (NFA)** was taken on the original reason she was arrested — a quiet admission that there was no case to answer. But in a move she believes was designed to intimidate and silence her, she was charged with **common assault on an emergency worker**.\n\nShe insists she is innocent.\n\n> \n> “I’ve never hit anyone in my life,” she says. “I was terrified. I was begging for help.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nShe doesn’t deny being emotional. She doesn’t deny shouting. But she does deny violence — and has no history of it whatsoever.\n\nStill, the process dragged on. Her health deteriorated. When the court date for her plea hearing came, she was too unwell to attend. So she did what she thought was right: she **requested a CVP (remote video hearing)**, supported by medical documents.\n\nThe evidence she submitted wasn’t vague. It included:\n\n- A **letter from her GP**\n\n- Two **ISVA support letters** from New Pathways\n\n- A previous letter from her surgery\n\n- A **26-page psychological report** from Professor Jenny Shaw, one of the UK’s leading forensic psychiatrists\n\nBut the **Magistrates’ Court refused the request.**\nThey issued a **warrant for her arrest**.\n\n> \n> “How is that fair?” she asks. “They have all this proof that I’m ill, disabled, and traumatised by the police. And they still want to drag me in like I’m dangerous.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nHer solicitor — who she says has offered little support — had promised to pursue an **abuse of process hearing** and request that the case be moved out of Wales entirely. But those steps were never taken. She’s now left fighting a system she believes is more focused on protecting itself than seeking justice.\n\nAnd it’s not just a fear of being found guilty. It’s a fear of **what could happen if she ends up behind bars**.\n\n> \n> “It is no exaggeration to say that if they send me to prison, I won’t survive,” she says. “I’d rather end my life than be assaulted by them again.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n## **Nowhere Safe – The Harassment Continues**\n\nShe isn’t safe — not in her own home, and not in her own mind.\n\nThe police say the matter is in hand. That the process is fair. That there’s nothing to worry about.\n\nBut she’s not convinced.\n\nJust days ago, **three officers appeared at her front door again**. She wasn’t home. She was staying with a friend, trying to recover, trying to breathe. When she reviewed her camera footage and saw them standing there, her heart sank. Not again. Not now. Not when she’s barely holding on.\n\n> \n> “I’m not exaggerating,” she says. “I’m terrified. I don’t sleep properly. I check the windows. I panic when there’s a knock.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nShe’s not just fighting a court case — she’s fighting a full psychological assault from the very institution that’s meant to uphold the law.\n\nShe says she’s been stalked by officers. Ignored when she’s tried to raise safeguarding concerns. And left to fear that her life could spiral — or end — with just one more knock on the door.\n\nThere are moments when she clings to hope. A few good friends. Some distant advocacy. But when the people supposed to protect you are the ones who hurt you, **where do you go?**\n\n---\n\n## **The Last Line – Her Words, Her Warning**\n\nShe never wanted to be a voice for anyone.\n\nShe just wanted to survive.\n\nBut after being failed by the justice system, assaulted in her own home — twice — and left to face the consequences while her abuser walks free, she’s found herself in a place no survivor should have to be: the one sounding the alarm.\n\nShe knows some will question her. Some will try to silence her. But her message is clear:\n\n> \n> “This isn’t justice. This is retaliation.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nHer calls for accountability have been ignored. Her medical needs dismissed. Her fear, minimised. All while officers who assaulted her remain unpunished — and the man she reported for raping a child lives freely, with no restrictions, and no risk order.\n\nThe apology from South Wales Police means nothing now.\nNot when the harm continues.\nNot when she fears prison.\nNot when she checks the door every time she hears a noise — heart racing, wondering if it’s them again.\n\nShe doesn’t want sympathy.\nShe wants people to understand what’s happening. To see how the system bends, protects itself, and leaves survivors in the dirt.\n\n> \n> “I’m not safe,” she says. “And if this system can do this to me — after all I’ve already survived — it can do it to anyone.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nThis isn’t just her story.\nIt’s a warning.\n\n---\n\n> \n> **Support Survivors:**\n> Louise has now launched a public page to continue sharing her story and support other survivors.

It’s the raw truth of a woman who reported her childhood abuse to South Wales Police — and was left traumatised not just by her abuser, but by the very system meant to protect her.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>What started as a brave step forward — disclosing years of child sexual abuse and helping bring a known, violent man to court — quickly spiralled into something unimaginable. Over the next few years, she would endure a deeply flawed police investigation, multiple failed trials, and a complete absence of victim safeguarding. But worse still, she would find herself on the receiving end of police violence, arrest, humiliation, and silencing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Despite securing a civil settlement and public apology from South Wales Police after one unlawful arrest, it happened again. Officers from the same station returned. The fear, the trauma, and the physical assault were repeated — this time while she begged an ambulance service to help her.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now, she’s battling not only the trauma of her past but also a court case she believes is designed to shut her up. Her mental and physical health have deteriorated. She’s terrified — and she’s running out of strength.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is her story.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-report-and-the-trial-that-was-never-meant-to-succeed\">\u003Cstrong>The Report and the Trial That Was Never Meant to Succeed\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The woman’s ordeal with South Wales Police began when she reported historical child sexual abuse. The alleged perpetrator, Robert Witchell, was eventually charged with \u003Cstrong>nine counts of rape of a child\u003C/strong> — a significant and serious case. But even as charges were brought, it was already clear the investigation had deep flaws.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>South Wales Police never arrested Witchell. They failed to seize his electronic devices or gather critical evidence. There were missed opportunities throughout the investigation — moments that could have strengthened the case, protected the survivor, and potentially saved others. But those moments were lost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Meanwhile, they did seize \u003Cem>her\u003C/em> devices — a move she found both confusing and traumatising, especially given the lack of similar action against the man accused of harming her.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Three trials were brought forward. The first ended early when the jury was discharged. The second and third both resulted in partial acquittals and hung juries. After that, the CPS chose not to proceed. Her Independent Sexual Violence Advocate (ISVA), who had supported survivors through many trials, described the entire legal process as “the most shambolic” she’d ever witnessed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Despite the gravity of the charges, there were \u003Cstrong>no safeguarding orders\u003C/strong> put in place for her protection. No Sexual Risk Order. No structured monitoring. No risk management. She was left exposed — and the man she had accused, free.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17443749204052886762994789172559.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17443749226704295796994505076911.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17443749246665489452760124073994.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17443749276657676127720397566340.jpg?w=860\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-first-arrest--230am-no-warning-no-dignity\">\u003Cstrong>The First Arrest – 2:30AM, No Warning, No Dignity\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>While the man she accused was never arrested, she was.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the early hours of the morning, around 2:30AM, \u003Cstrong>three police officers from Maesteg Station\u003C/strong> — \u003Cstrong>PC Lauren Evans, PC Ben Griffiths, and PC Simon Smith\u003C/strong> — turned up at her home. She was not considered a threat, had no violent record, and the alleged offence was a minor, summary-only matter. Yet what followed was a full-force response that left her traumatised.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She describes being dragged from her home and \u003Cstrong>exposed in front of male officers\u003C/strong>, her body left uncovered during the arrest. She remembers the fear, the shock, and the deep humiliation — emotions that haven’t faded since.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The charge she faced at the time was eventually dropped. She was \u003Cstrong>never found guilty\u003C/strong> of any wrongdoing. But the experience left a mark that no apology could erase.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At a time when police had failed to arrest an accused child rapist, they used force against a vulnerable woman with no history of violence. And while no action was taken to secure his devices, \u003Cstrong>hers were seized.\u003C/strong> To her, it felt like a message: \u003Cstrong>you are the one under scrutiny.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The impact was devastating. She later admitted she didn’t want to be alive anymore. Still, somehow, she got through the trials. She waited for justice.

No risk assessment was shared. No warning was issued to communities. The man she had accused — with a history of convictions, including for violence against partners — was allowed to return to daily life \u003Cstrong>with no restrictions at all.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Meanwhile, she was left alone. Terrified. Traumatised. And increasingly convinced that the system had abandoned her.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So she did what the police wouldn’t: she warned people. She posted Witchell’s name and location on local Facebook groups to \u003Cstrong>alert others\u003C/strong> and keep children safe. Her intention wasn’t revenge — it was survival. She didn’t want anyone else to suffer what she had.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But South Wales Police didn’t see it that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They invited her to a \u003Cstrong>voluntary interview (VA)\u003C/strong>.

And it handed him another child anyway.**\n\n---\n\n### **The Grooming Never Stopped. It Just Got Legitimised.**\n\nThis is the part no one talks about:\n\nThe criminal justice system didn’t protect her. It paid her.\n\n**£22,000.** That’s what she got from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority — an official recognition that she was abused.\n\nBut recognition isn’t justice.\n**Her abuser still walks free. Still has no conviction.**\n\nWorse — the family court saw fit to grant him **residence of their 14-year-old daughter**. A girl he’s now grooming too.\n\nHow many red flags do they need?\n\n---\n\n### **How Many Times Must Survivors Be Failed?**\n\nLet’s run this again:\n\n- A teenage girl was groomed by a 19-year-old man.\n\n- She endured 17 years of rape, control, and post-separation abuse.\n\n- She raised his children.\n\n- He never faced court.\n\n- And now the court has delivered another child directly into his care.\n\nYou’d expect this in a dystopian novel. But this is happening *here*, *now*, *in Britain* — and no one is being held accountable.\n\n---\n\n### **These Aren’t Gaps in the System. They Are the System.**\n\nPeople always ask: *“How could this happen?”*\nAs if it’s a mystery. As if it’s rare.\n\nIt’s not.\n\nThe system is built to protect men like him.\nMen who are charming, manipulative, “respectable.”\nMen who know how to play the role.\nMen who know that **if they’re never convicted, they’re untouchable** — no matter how much damage they leave behind.\n\nIt protects fathers before it protects children.\nIt protects reputations before it protects lives.\n\n---\n\n### **Family Court Is One of the Most Dangerous Places for Survivors**\n\nHe didn’t just groom her.\nHe didn’t just rape her.\nHe didn’t just control her for years.\n\nHe **used the family court to keep control** — and the court let him.\n\nSurvivors are expected to co-parent with their rapists.\nThey’re told to “move on” while their abusers use child contact as a weapon.\n\nThis isn’t poor practice.\nThis is **state-sanctioned re-traumatisation**.\n\n---\n\n### **The Questions No One Wants to Ask:**\n\n- Why does a compensation payout confirm abuse — but lead to no prosecution?\n\n- Why does a family court ignore a man’s history of grooming and award him custody?\n\n- Why are girls still expected to prove they were “abused enough” to be believed?\n\n- Why are survivors discarded while predators are legally protected?\n\nYou know why.\nBecause challenging men like him would mean **challenging the institutions that shielded him.**\n\nAnd they’d rather protect their image than admit complicity.\n\n---\n\n### **She’s Still Paying the Price.

She cried out. She begged to be seen.\n\n**Nobody fucking listened.**\n\nInstead, she was passed around — a case file on a desk, a scared little girl with a social worker whose name she can't even remember now.\nPoor. Bullied. Laughed at for the way she walked — her limp a physical memory of beatings too old for her young body to carry.\n\nThe house smelled of cigarettes, stale alcohol, and despair.\nThe only constants were violence, chaos, and the thick, heavy feeling of knowing that help wasn’t coming.\n\nHer body learned dissociation early — a child trapped inside herself — brain fogging over in protection as her stepfather pressed himself against her back on the living room sofa, her frozen body trapped under the weight of shame she couldn't even name yet.\n\nHe gave her money sometimes — little bribes.\nHe followed her around the house like a hunter tracking prey.\nAnd at school, when the teachers and Girl Guides leaders noticed the bandages on her arms, they asked questions H didn’t know how to answer.\nHad she self-harmed? She doesn't know.\nThe memories are stitched together like badly mended fabric — pieces missing, others too vivid to bear.\n\n**But the belt?**\nShe remembers the belt.\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000bcfc623096564acf64085ec2_conversation_id3d67ef8bd1-d7f8-8002-bb69-a196cda329de26message_id3de913c0f9-dc7b-4d57-ab16-05b65d4af99b6335863721149425145.jpg?w=683)\n\n---\n\n## **The Years Nobody Saved Her**\n\nViolence was so normal in H’s world that it barely raised a ripple anymore.\nBroken doors, smashed plates, the sting of belt buckles slashing across skin — it was the background noise of her childhood.\n\nShe learned to read the room the way other kids learned to read bedtime stories.\nA glance at her stepfather's clenched jaw, his belt hanging from his hand — that was enough.\nShe knew when to flinch. She knew when to hide.\n\nBut nowhere was safe.\n\nWhen she wasn’t being beaten, she was being stalked inside her own home — followed from room to room, his presence thick and heavy behind her.\nThe sofa became a place of terror.\nShe can still feel the shame of lying there, frozen, as he pressed his erect penis against her small back, her body curling into itself, willing it not to be real.\n\nShe started dissociating so young she didn’t even have a word for it.\nShe’d drift somewhere else — anywhere else — while the horror happened.\n\nAt school, the bullying never stopped.\nH walked with a limp, a leftover wound nobody asked about.\nHer clothes were worn-out.\nHer eyes were hollowed-out.\nShe carried trauma in every step, and the world looked away.\n\nEven when she tried to speak — to friends, to teachers, to Girl Guides leaders — the system stayed silent.\nA friend’s mother found out what was happening and told H’s mum.\n\n**Still, nothing changed.**\n\nHer home wasn’t a home. It was a battleground.\n\nThe family dog turned on her once — savage and bloody.\nAnother trip to hospital. Another scar.\nComfort eating became survival.\nShe would stuff food into her mouth, hoarding it like treasure, scared it would be taken away.\nSometimes she hid it in her cheeks.\nOther times, she hid it in the walls.\n\nFood wasn’t nourishment in H’s life — it was control, punishment, a weapon.\n\nBy the time she hit her teenage years, the violence escalated again.\nHer brother, himself brutalised by years of violence, turned on her too.\nThe abuse came from every direction now — fists, words, groping hands, broken promises.\n\nPinned down. Taunted.\nBruised in ways no one ever saw.\nNot just by strangers — by her own blood.\n\nAnd still — still — **nobody came.**\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_0000000029c8620a9970ca2692a46ce05125633478930237815.png?w=683)\n\n---\n\n## **Dragged Deeper: Grooming, Betrayal, and the Streets**\n\nAt thirteen, H finally left her mother’s house — but not by choice.\nShe was shunted off to her aunt’s home, passed like a burden nobody wanted to carry anymore.\nIt was supposed to be a fresh start.\nIt was supposed to be safety.\n\nIt wasn’t.\n\nThere was a man who started staying at her aunt’s house.\nAt first, it was innocent — or so H thought.\nWatching films together. Joking around.\n\nBut predators don’t announce themselves.\nThey move quietly.\nThey wait for their moment.\n\nBy fifteen, that man had groomed her — broken her boundaries so completely that when he initiated sexual contact, H didn’t even fight.\nShe dissociated instead — the one defence she'd learned that actually worked.\n\nWhen her aunt found out, H wasn't offered support.\nShe wasn’t protected.\n\n**She was kicked out.**\n\nAnother home lost. Another adult choosing blame over protection.\n\nHomelessness became H’s reality.\nBouncing between hostels and the streets, sleeping under trees in the pouring rain.\nShe remembers clutching 25p so tightly in her pocket that it left an imprint on her skin.\nOne sweet a day — that’s how she survived.\nNo teenager should ever have to survive like that.\n\nAt sixteen, she returned to her mother’s house, skeletal from anorexia, her body buckling under starvation and trauma.\n\nBut safety still wasn’t waiting for her.\n\nHer brother, now older and meaner, used his dog as a weapon — setting it on H to terrify her into submission.\nMealtimes became torture sessions, not nourishment.\nShe wasn’t allowed to leave the table until she'd eaten, her mother and siblings trapping her, taunting her, policing every bite.\nAnd when she couldn’t force the food down, H learned new ways to rebel — hiding food in her mouth, vomiting secretly, scraping meals into the walls if she had to.\n\nShe lived in terror of eating.\nShe lived in terror of *not* eating.\n\nBy now, the drugs were creeping in — numbing the hunger, the pain, the endless ache of being unprotected.\n\nAnd then Uncle P reappeared.\n\nThe man she had been sent to when she was \"naughty,\" as a child.\nThe man who had surrounded her with paedophiles.\nThe man who had abused her too.\n\nNow, he was back — and the cycle of abuse circled like a vulture.\n\nAt eighteen, H managed to claw some kind of freedom — her own flat.\nOnly to realise in horror it was **above Uncle P's flat**.\n\nThe nightmare was never finished.\nIt simply changed rooms.\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000576c6243b9ab909f802a45145613440998472448283.png?w=683)\n\n---\n\n## **Adulthood Came — But Safety Never Did**\n\nH was barely more than a child when she tried to build her own life.\nShe moved into a tiny flat above her abuser.\nIt wasn’t independence — it was survival, in whatever scraps she could find.\n\nBy eighteen, she was back under her mother’s roof again — not because she wanted to be, but because there was nowhere else to go.\nThe same roof where trauma still lived in every wall, in every breath, in the space between her and her brother, her sister, her mother.\nThe same brother who had once pinned her down now terrorised his own wife, carrying on the violence like an inheritance.\n\nH clung to anything that resembled hope.\nShe fell into relationships, had children, tried to rebuild.\nBut trauma leaves fingerprints on everything.\nOne of her children’s fathers — a man H barely knew, a one-night stand — turned out to be abusive too.\nThe same horrors H had lived through as a girl were now threatening to touch her children.\n\nAnd when her daughter — brave, terrified — came forward at sixteen to disclose abuse?\n\nH did what no adult ever had for her.\n\nShe believed her daughter.\nShe fought for her.\nShe went to social services and told them everything.\n\nAnd what did the system do?\n**No Further Action.**\n\nThe same indifference that had abandoned H now abandoned her daughter.\n\nThe weight of it all — the generational trauma, the failures, the betrayals — collapsed onto H's shoulders.\nMisdiagnosed by mental health teams who didn’t look past their checklists.\nDiscriminated against because of her autism, treated like a problem to be contained instead of a mother fighting for her child.\n\nSocial workers, judges, so-called professionals — they didn’t see her.\nNot the scared child.\nNot the broken teenager.\nNot the woman standing there now, begging them to look deeper.\n\nAnd they stole her children from her.\n\nRipped them away and called it protection.\nAs if the system wasn’t the one who had failed to protect in the first place.\n\nH became another statistic, another \"troubled mother\" file in a cabinet somewhere.\n\nBut she is not a file.\nShe is not a statistic.\nShe is a survivor who was brutalised by her family, by predators, and by a system that promised care and delivered cruelty.\n\nAnd still — still — she fights.\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_000000003150624392a66ab0856725087813868445455001565.png?w=683)\n\n---\n\n## **Still Standing: The Fight H Should Never Have Had to Fight**\n\nToday, H is in her 40's.\nShe carries fibromyalgia through her bones — a chronic, relentless pain born from a lifetime of trauma her body never had the chance to heal.\nShe fights through brain fog, memory gaps, anxiety that gnaws at her even on the good days.\n\nBut she's still here.\nStill fighting.\n\nThe nightmares never fully left.\nThe smell of cigarette smoke, the sight of a messy room, the clink of loose change in a jar — all of it can drag her back in a second.\nBack to brown nighties.\nBack to sofa cushions and belts.\nBack to a childhood stolen and a womanhood betrayed.\n\nHer mind flashes with memories sometimes — sitting at a piano with her grandfather, the only adult who made her feel safe, even if just for a moment.\nHis warmth is one of the only lights she holds onto from her earliest years.\nEverything else is stained by violence, shame, and survival.\n\nH was misdiagnosed over and over by mental health services who saw the symptoms but refused to see the cause.\nAnd when her autism diagnosis came — something that should have offered understanding, protection, and rights — it was used instead as a weapon against her.\nTwisted in courtrooms and reports to paint her as \"unfit.\"\n\nNot a survivor.\nNot a mother doing her best against impossible odds.\nBut a problem to be managed.\nA case to be closed.\n\n**They stole her children.**\n\nThe same system that failed to protect her at five, ten, fifteen, twenty — failed her all over again as a mother.\n\nAnd still — H does not give up.\nShe is fighting for her children.\nFighting for her voice.\nFighting for the child she was — the child who screamed for help into the void and was met with silence.\n\nH is not just a survivor.\nShe is a testament to everything that is wrong with the systems built to protect the vulnerable — and everything that is right with the human spirit that refuses to be destroyed.\n\nHer story demands more than sympathy.\nIt demands change.\n\nThe system doesn't just need fixing — it needs tearing down and rebuilding with survivors at the heart.\nIt needs to start listening, really listening, to the H's of this world — not when it's too late, but when it still matters.\n\nBecause no child should have to grow up like this.\nAnd no woman should have to spend her life picking up the pieces the system was supposed to protect in the first place.\n\nH deserved better.\nHer children deserved better.\n\nAnd we have a responsibility — all of us — to make sure her fight wasn’t in vain.\n\n---","src/content/articles/they-never-listened-her-fight-for-survival.md","0d542d8a3b994188",{"html":6232,"metadata":6233},"\u003Cp>By Sophie Lewis - The Grooming Files | The Indie Leaks |

someone said to me recently. Casually. As if it were just a passing fact.\nBut those six words are everything that’s wrong with how society views abuse.\n\nLet’s be real: no child — no one — seeks out manipulation, sexualisation, or harm. But somehow, when it comes to young girls, people still lean on this tired, lazy narrative. As if the responsibility for abuse lies not with the adult who groomed, coerced, or violated them — but with the child who was “asking for it.”\n\nThis isn’t just ignorance. It’s dangerous. And it needs to be called out.\n\nBecause when we say “those girls go looking for it,” what we’re really saying is:\n\nThey deserved it.\nThey brought it on themselves.\nIt’s not the abuser’s fault.\n\nLet’s flip that.\n\n---\n\n### **Where That Belief Comes From — And Why It’s Wrong**\n\nThe idea that “girls go looking for it” doesn’t come from nowhere. It’s passed down — through cultural conditioning, outdated gender roles, and a society that teaches girls to be desirable, then punishes them for being noticed.\n\nIt shows up in the way we police girls’ clothes more than boys’ behaviour.\nIn how we ask “Why didn’t she speak up?” instead of “Why did they target her?”\nIn courtrooms. In classrooms. In everyday conversation.\n\nIt’s easier for people to believe a child brought it on themselves than to accept that adults — family members, teachers, neighbours, strangers — could be capable of such betrayal. Denial feels safer than truth.\n\nBut denial keeps the cycle going.\n\nBecause here’s the reality: no matter how a young girl acts, speaks, or dresses — an adult always has the responsibility to know better. To do better. To not cross the line.\n\nSaying she “went looking for it” isn’t just wrong. It’s cruel.\nIt silences her pain and protects the person who caused it.\n\n---\n\n### **What Girls Are Actually Looking For**\n\nWhen we take the time to really understand, it becomes clear:\nGirls aren’t looking for abuse.\nThey’re looking for something that feels missing.\n\nFor love.\nFor connection.\nFor a way out of a chaotic home, a violent relationship, or a life that feels too heavy too soon.\n\nSome are escaping neglect. Others, emotional abandonment. Some just want someone to see them, hear them, care.\n\nAnd predators know this.\n\nThey don’t lure with force — they lure with attention. Compliments. Secrets. Comfort. They fill the gaps left by others, then twist that bond into control.\n\nWhat might look from the outside like a “choice” is, in reality, the result of unmet needs and deep vulnerability. No child has the full understanding or power to consent to something they don’t even realise is happening.\n\nSo no — they’re not “looking for it.”\nThey’re looking to feel okay.\nAnd that should never be used against them.\n\n---\n\n### **Predators Don’t Accidentally Find Victims**\n\nLet’s stop pretending predators stumble into these situations. They don’t.\n\nThey seek out the vulnerable.\nThey groom with intent.\nThey study their victims, gain their trust, and isolate them — slowly and strategically.\n\nBy the time anything physical happens, the emotional grip is already strong. Victims might even believe they’re in love. Or that they chose it. That’s what makes grooming so sinister — it’s abuse wrapped in confusion and manipulation.\n\nAnd the truth is, what these girls are looking for?\nPredators are already watching.\n\nThey don’t choose randomly.\nThey choose carefully.\n\nAnd every time we blame the victim instead of looking at how abusers operate, we make it easier for them to do it again.\n\n---\n\n### **The Cost of Blame — What Survivors Carry**\n\nThe damage doesn’t end when the abuse stops. For many, the blame follows them long after the predator disappears. And what makes it worse? It’s often not just the abuser’s voice they carry — it’s everyone else’s too.\n\nHere’s what survivors have said:\n\n> \n> “People kept asking why I went back. Why I didn’t run. But no one asked why he chose me in the first place.”\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> “They said I was fast. Said I must’ve wanted it. I was 14. I just wanted someone to care.”\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> “The hardest part wasn’t what he did to me. It was what everyone else thought about me after.”\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> “I was groomed, abused, manipulated — and then shamed for it like I was the one who ruined everything.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nThese are not rare stories. These are common.\nAccording to the NSPCC, one in twenty children in the UK has been sexually abused. Most don’t tell anyone. Many never do.\n\nWhy? Because they hear these phrases in their homes, in schools, on social media:\n“She led him on.”\n“She’s always been mature for her age.”\n“She went back, so it couldn’t have been that bad.”\n\nThis language reinforces the silence.\nAnd silence protects predators.\n\nWhen society labels victims as complicit in their own abuse, it doesn’t just hurt — it isolates. It adds shame on top of trauma. And for some, that weight becomes too heavy to carry.\n\nThis is why the narrative has to change.\n\n---\n\n### **Changing the Narrative — What Needs to Shift**\n\nIt starts with how we talk.\n\nStop saying “she was asking for it.”\nStart asking, “Why did he think he could get away with it?”\n\nStop focusing on what she wore.\nStart asking where the adults were who should have been protecting her.\n\nWe need to shift blame from children to the adults who failed them.\nTo hold space for survivors instead of shaming them.\nTo listen without judgement.\nTo teach our kids what grooming looks like, so they can recognise it early.\n\nAnd most of all — to believe them when they speak.\n\n---\n\n### **This Is Bigger Than One Girl**\n\nThis article is part of The Grooming Files — a space to expose the silence, challenge the systems, and centre survivor voices.\n\nBecause the truth is: those girls could be anyone’s daughter, sister, cousin, friend.\nAnd blaming them for what happened isn’t just unfair — it’s unsafe.\n\nIt’s time we got loud about the realities no one wants to face.\nIt’s time we stopped protecting predators with our silence.\nAnd it’s time we stopped confusing a cry for help with consent.\n\nTruth heals.\nSilence protects predators.\nShame keeps us chained.\n\nWe break the cycle by naming it, facing it, and refusing to carry it any longer.\n\n---","src/content/articles/those-girls-go-looking-for-it-the-words-that-keep-us-silent.md","08280588163dccfe",{"html":6276,"metadata":6277},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>©️ Written By - Soph\u003C/em>ie Lewis\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/file-6ctcrrqqjuxvfehgmsiuch1757850915481559876.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>“Those Girls Go Looking for It”\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That’s what someone said to me recently.

My notes were ready. He looked nervous but steady.\n\nAnd I didn’t waste time.\nI opened with the simplest — and hardest — question I could:\n\n> \n> *“What are you — not by label, not by law, but in your own words?”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nHis face changed instantly.\nPanic. Silence. Darting eyes.\nThe weight of that mirror hit fast.\n\nHe tried to speak — but couldn’t.\n\nHe asked to pause. Then reschedule. Then tried to change the format.\n\nSuddenly, everything was too much.\nToo intense.\nToo soon.\nToo real.\n\n> \n> *“I can’t do it.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nAfter three days of saying he was ready, one question showed he wasn’t.\nNot ready to be accountable.\nNot ready to name himself.\nNot ready for truth.\n\n---\n\n## **Why That Question Broke Him**\n\nIt wasn’t cruel.\nIt wasn’t graphic.\nIt didn’t name his crime or force a confession.\n\nIt asked him to define himself.\nNot with legal labels or media headlines — but with his own language.\n\nAnd predators don’t speak well in mirrors.\nThey speak in performance.\nIn control.\nIn fog.\n\nThis question pierced that fog.\nAnd once it did, the act was over.\n\n---\n\n## **The Final Interview — 17 Minutes That Said Everything**\n\nI didn’t expect him to return.\nBut days later, he messaged again.\nSaid he wanted to try once more.\n\n> \n> *“I’m ready now.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nAnd so we sat down again.\nSame format.\nSame expectations.\nSame promise of truth.\n\nThis time, the interview lasted 17 minutes.\n\nHe answered every question.\nSoftly. Flatly. Carefully.\nNo tears. No anger. Just... answers.\n\nBut what struck me most wasn’t what he said.\n\nIt was how hollow it all felt.\nLike he was speaking lines from a play he didn’t believe in.\n\n---\n\n## **What the Camera Captured**\n\nSeventeen minutes.\nAnd still no real ownership.\n\n- He talked about what he’d done\n\n- He admitted to Xbox chats, masturbation, underage conversations\n\n- He answered direct questions about guilt, mindset, change\n\nBut his focus stayed the same:\nWhat *he* lost.\nHow *he* felt.\nWhy *he* wanted to talk now — to feel better. To sleep better.\n\nNot once did he mention the victims.\nNot once did he say their pain mattered.\nNot once did he apologise.\n\nEven when asked:\n\n> \n> *“What would you say to a child victim reading this one day?”*\n> He replied:\n> *“I really don’t know. That’s the truth.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\n---\n\n## **Why This Interview Still Matters**\n\nIt wasn’t explosive.\nIt wasn’t shocking.\nIt wasn’t a breakdown or a dramatic reveal.\n\nIt was slow.\nUncomfortable.\nDetached.\n\nBut that’s **exactly** why it matters.\n\nBecause *this is how predators operate* in the everyday.\nThis is what it looks like when they’re not behind bars or being chased by cameras.\nThis is what it sounds like when they think they’re being “honest.”\n\nNot screaming.\nNot violent.\nJust manipulative. Measured.\nStill trying to steer the ship — even from a sinking seat.\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_000000006d2c5230a7780cce5257f819_conversation_id3d67ef8bd1-d7f8-8002-bb69-a196cda329de26message_id3d63d603e8-1b46-42f0-b7e6-1d4964ed24b48742595952533473130.jpg?w=683)\n\n## **What It Took From Me**\n\nConducting this wasn’t brave.\nIt was brutal.\n\nI walked away from that 17-minute call with my body in shutdown mode again:\n\n- Head pounding\n\n- Freezing cold\n\n- Mind fogged\n\n- Nerves on fire\n\nHe’d said what he wanted to say.\nAnd I’d let him — for the sake of documenting a reality no one else sees.\n\nBut what people forget is…\n**just because the interview ended doesn’t mean the impact did.**\n\nFor him, it was a performance.\nFor me, it was a reckoning.\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000b99861fab1afbbad99512646_conversation_id3d68016b3d-6850-8002-9c00-e528503a5dc826message_id3d474f9b74-b5c1-4f33-8ab0-e45eedde36b34012346989702454034.jpg?w=1024)\n\n## **The Mirror Stayed On — Even When He Didn’t**\n\nIn the end, this isn’t about what he admitted.\nIt’s about what his face did when truth showed up.\n\nHe wanted to be exposed — but on his terms.\nHe wanted redemption — but without reflection.\nHe wanted relief — without responsibility.\n\nAnd when he couldn’t get those things, he crumbled.\nBecause I wasn’t there to stroke his shame.\n\nI was there to **record it.**\n\n---\n\n## **Why This Series Exists**\n\nBecause no one’s asking these questions.\nBecause no one’s staying in the room when the predator gets uncomfortable.\nBecause too many outlets want trauma *wrapped in redemption*, not reality.\n\nBut this is reality.\nAnd it’s ugly.\nAnd it’s uncomfortable.\nAnd it’s **truth**.\n\nNot from a court.\nNot from a crime doc.\nFrom a survivor — who asked, recorded, and reflected.\n\nSo if this series made you squirm — good.\nIf it made you look away — good.\n\nBecause that’s what victims have had to do our whole lives.\n\nAnd now?\nNow the mirror’s pointing the other way.\n\n---\n\n**Appreciate my work?

Voluntary. Repeated. Unprovoked.**\n\nHe reached out through my page — the kind of message you scan past at first. Casual.\n“Do you believe in exposing people on the sex offender register?”\n\nIt didn’t even sound personal. It read like curiosity.\n\nI replied honestly. Like I always do.\n\n“Yes. I do.”\n\nIt was only after a few more messages that the truth dropped —\nHe wasn’t asking about someone else.\nHe was talking about himself.\n\n> \n> “I used to talk to underage kids on Xbox. I got done for it. Everyone in my old town knows. I lost everything.”\n> “I’ve never told anyone the full story. I don’t know why I’m telling you.”\n> “I want to tell someone.”\n> “I need help.”\n> “You look genuine.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nAnd suddenly I was in it.\n**Not a journalist documenting a case.**\nNot an activist sharing survivor stories.\nBut a **survivor** being chosen — handpicked — by a predator who wanted to confess.\n\nThat moment changed everything.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Me?**\n\nI asked myself this over and over.\n\nWhy did he choose *me*?\n\nBecause I write openly about grooming?\nBecause I don't flinch when the truth gets graphic?\nBecause I walk the line between survivor and speaker, activist and investigator?\n\nWhatever the reason, he decided I was \"safe.\"\nSafe enough to disclose to.\nBut not safe enough to respect.\n\nHe wanted relief, not redemption.\nA stage, not accountability.\n\nI knew what I was dealing with almost immediately.\nThe language was fractured — a mix of guilt, performance, self-pity, and control.\nHe didn’t say, *I hurt people.*\nHe said, *I lost everything.*\n\nHe didn’t say, *I want to own it.*\nHe said, *I want to feel better.*\n\nAnd yet —\nI stayed in the conversation.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I’ve never seen it done before.\nNot like this.\n**Not a predator in open dialogue with a survivor — under full consent, on record, asked questions no one else dares to ask.**\n\nI realised this wasn’t just an interaction.\nIt was a case study.\nA psychological profile unfolding in real time.\nA rare opportunity to look the predator in the face — *not with pity, but precision*.\n\nAnd more than that —\n**I felt a duty to document it.**\n\n---\n\n### **What Followed Was Three Days of Psychological Descent**\n\nThree days of speaking with him.\nText. Voice. Video.\nConsent repeated.\nBoundaries laid down.\nQuestions asked — not once, but over and over.\n\nAnd with every hour that passed, I saw more than just the man.\nI saw **the pattern**.\nThe tactics.\nThe fear.\nThe ego.\nThe obsession with being *seen*, but never *truly seen*.\n\nIt started as a “story.”\nBut it turned into a survival exercise.\n\nFor me.\n\nBecause the moment he attached himself to me, my body started to shut down.\nHeadaches. Brain fog. Cold sweats.\nA full-body trauma response — **before I even realised what was happening.**\n\nI hadn’t let the predator in.\nBut I’d opened the door to what they carry.\n\nAnd once you let it in… you can’t just shake it off.\n\n---\n\n## **The Weight of Saying Yes**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_000000006bdc622fb7ec482c065f39dd_conversation_id3d68016b3d-6850-8002-9c00-e528503a5dc826message_id3d31b4e3b9-4abf-41ea-a9c2-da94eb61353928129666110167015634824.jpg?w=1024)\n\nThey think the worst part is reading what he said.\nHearing what he admitted to.\nWatching the interview.\n\nIt’s not.\n\nThe worst part came after I said yes.\n\nAfter I agreed to keep speaking.\nTo listen.\nTo ask the questions.\nTo create the space.\nTo document this thing in full.\n\nThat “yes” sounded so small at the time.\nBut it cracked something open inside me that hasn’t stopped leaking since.\n\n---\n\n### **What No One Tells You**\n\nNo one tells you what it does to your body —\nsitting across from the type of man who once shattered you, even if it’s not *him* exactly.\nNo one tells you what it’s like to keep your voice steady\nwhile your chest tightens like a vice.\nTo type clearly\nwhile your stomach clenches like it remembers every violation.\nTo analyse a man’s words\nwhile your own trauma starts crawling up your spine.\n\n**For three days I was a shell.**\n\nA walking trauma response.\nI was cold — freezing, even under blankets.\nHead pounding.\nShaking hands.\nClenched jaw.\nSpaced-out thoughts.\n\nMy body was in danger.\nEven though *I wasn’t*.\nEven though I knew I was the one in control.\n\nThat’s what trauma does.\nIt doesn’t care about logic.\nIt remembers before you do.\n\n---\n\n### **The Cost of Curiosity**\n\nSome people will ask why I kept going.\n\nWhy I didn’t just block him.\nWhy I didn’t hand it over to someone else.\nWhy I didn’t walk away when it got too much.\n\nAnd the truth is — I tried.\n\nI thought about stopping. I even planned to.\nBut then he kept talking.\nAnd what he said was rare. Raw. Wrong.\nBut *real*.\n\nI knew I wasn’t just hearing *his* story.\nI was hearing **a template**.\nA pattern.\nThe same psychology behind thousands of unsolved cases and system failures and hushed-up reports.\n\nI was watching what society doesn’t understand — not because it’s hidden,\nbut because **no one’s ever stayed in the room long enough to document it.**\n\nI was exhausted. Sick.\nBut I knew that if I walked away now, this thing would disappear into silence again.\n\nAnd that silence?\nIt protects no one.\nIt educates no one.\nIt changes nothing.\n\n---\n\n### **The Survivor Paradox**\n\nThere’s this myth that once you “heal,” predators lose their power over you.\n\nBut healing isn’t a shield.\nIt’s a mirror.\nAnd mirrors don’t deflect — they **reflect**.\n\nEvery time he spoke,\nI saw reflections of those who hurt me.\nThe excuses.\nThe justifications.\nThe obsession with being understood but never held accountable.\n\nHe reminded me of the ones who lied to my face and called it care.\nThe ones who confused attention with safety.\nThe ones who got away with it because they were \"nice\" and \"broken\" and “just needed help.”\n\nAnd that’s why I kept going.\n\nBecause I wasn’t just speaking to **him**.\nI was speaking to *all of them*.\nThrough him.\nPast him.\nFor every survivor who never got to ask:\n**“Why did you do it?”**\n\nAnd every child who deserved a world where that question never had to exist in the first place.\n\n---\n\n## **The Performance of Remorse**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000d2dc6246ac47e1d837e45a56_conversation_id3d68016b3d-6850-8002-9c00-e528503a5dc826message_id3d7c1f223b-f211-4d6d-9d6d-c1d6035af9727301702396690907308.jpg?w=1024)\n\nHe didn’t open with truth.\nHe opened with **testing**.\n\n> \n> “You expose people, right?”\n> “Do you think the word ‘nonce’ is fair?”\n> “I lost everything.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nLike a toe in the water before the plunge.\nBefore he told me anything, he wanted to know what I’d let him get away with.\n\nThat’s the first thing I learned: Remorse is rarely the starting point.\nThe starting point is fear. Ego. Control.\nA need to shape the stage before stepping on it.\n\nHe didn’t offer a confession.\nHe offered a *preview* — laced with disclaimers, vagueness, and self-preservation.\n\n> \n> “I just need to talk to someone.”\n> “I’ve never told the full story.”\n> “I’m not like the rest.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nOver and over, he returned to the same refrain:\n*“I lost everything.”*\nNot: *“I hurt children.”*\nNot: *“I destroyed innocence.”*\nNot: *“I did this.”*\n\nJust what **he** had to endure.\n\n---\n\n### **He Wasn't Telling Me His Story — He Was Auditioning for It**\n\nEvery line felt like it was written for effect.\nHe played between vulnerability and deflection, honesty and ego.\nLike he wanted to appear broken enough to gain sympathy\nbut not broken enough to warrant real consequences.\n\nHe asked me if “nonce” was fair.\nWhen I said I didn’t use that word, he sighed with relief.\n\n> \n> “At least you won’t say it in front of me.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n**Control.** Again.\n\nThis wasn’t about being understood.\nIt was about making *me* behave the way he wanted.\nShaping how I saw him.\nEven in “confession,” he was still managing perception.\n\n---\n\n### **He Said He Wanted the Truth Out — But Only on His Terms**\n\nHe said he wanted to be exposed.\nSaid people “had the right to know.”\n\nBut the moment I held the mirror up to him —\n**He flinched.**\n\nHe stalled.

But it’s performance.**\nIt’s damage control. It’s “healing” without the howl.\n\n---\n\n### **This Is What a Survivor’s Lens Looks Like**\n\nI didn’t do this interview for shock value.\nI didn’t do it for clicks.\nI did it because **we are missing the entire psychology behind this crisis.**\n\nWe keep documenting outcomes.\nSentences. Trials. News headlines.\n\nBut we don’t document the **mind** behind the act.\nThe avoidance. The justifications. The ritualised dodging of truth.\nThe *refusal to name yourself honestly.*\n\nAnd until we face that, we’ll keep getting\nnew names,\nsame crimes,\nsame silence.\n\nThis isn’t about redemption.\nIt’s about excavation.\n\nI didn’t want his story.\nI wanted the **mechanism**.\nThe engine beneath the excuses.\n\nAnd I got it.\n\nSeventeen minutes of everything he couldn’t say.\nAnd three days of everything he couldn’t hide.\n\n---\n\n## **The Silence Around Us — And the Fire It Sparked in Me**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1541b72f6b9788afa7e7bd5bff624081_07992544458291026435.jpeg?w=1024)\n\nFor three days, I walked through a minefield.\nNot just of his words — but of my own memories.\nMy own nerves. My own trauma, triggered by proximity to someone who *reminded* me of what I lived through.\n\nI carried it.\nI carried *him*.\nAnd I carried every moment of this experiment in silence, because I knew the system wouldn’t.\n\nI pitched the story.\nI offered the truth.\nI put a piece of my soul on the line — and **nobody answered.**\n\nThe press went quiet.\nThe inbox stayed empty.\nThe message?\n**“This is too much. Too uncomfortable. Too real.”**\n\nBut that’s exactly why I’m still writing.\n\n---\n\n### **Let Me Be Clear — This Is Not About Him**\n\nThis was never about giving him space.\n\nThis was about:\n\n- What happens when a survivor stares down the monster and doesn’t flinch.\n\n- What’s revealed when you cut the script and let silence speak.\n\n- What predators do when the mask of manipulation stops working.\n\nAnd what systems do in response?\n\n**They look away.**\n\nBecause this kind of truth? Doesn’t sell ads. Doesn’t win awards. Doesn’t sit nicely on a homepage between weather updates and celebrity gossip.\n\nBut this truth is *ours.*\n\nAnd I won’t let it rot in drafts and unread emails.\n\n---\n\n### **I’m Not Waiting for Permission Anymore**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_000000008cec61f6b8b92542f8b77fb1_conversation_id3d68016b3d-6850-8002-9c00-e528503a5dc826message_id3db6d8ab9c-a598-4bd4-90f1-3288ce5d6f124852339859276606506.jpg?w=683)\n\nI am a survivor.\nI am a journalist.\nAnd I am done softening my tone for platforms that fear discomfort more than they fear complicity.\n\nThis isn’t entertainment.\nThis is *evidence.*\n\nOf how predators behave.\nOf how they manipulate remorse.\nOf how they *test boundaries* even while claiming to be reformed.\n\nAnd it’s evidence of something else, too:\n\nThat when a survivor takes control of the story,\n**the narrative doesn’t just shift — it detonates.**\n\nThis was never about justice for him.\n\nIt was about power for us.\n\n---\n\n## **A New Kind of Justice.

I’m a Record-Keeper.**\n\nThis is not the last time I’ll do this.\nAnd it might not even be the hardest.\n\nBecause I’ve realised something:\n**The most radical thing a survivor can do is *ask the questions nobody else will.***\nAnd then answer them ourselves — with evidence, with rage, with clarity, and with *truth*.\n\nThis wasn’t just an exposé.\nIt was an experiment.\nA case study.\nA psychological breakdown of what predator performance looks like *up close*.\n\nAnd no one can unsee it now.\n\n---\n\n### **If the Press Won’t Print It — I Will.**\n\nIf editors can’t stomach it, I’ll publish it here.\nIf platforms want “sensitive” and “toned-down,” they’ll get silence from me instead.\n\nBecause I don’t write for headlines.\n\nI write for the girl I used to be — the one who was never given a warning.\nI write for every survivor who was told to be quiet, to be kind, to be careful.\nI write for the children still out there, scrolling, gaming, talking — being hunted while no one watches.\n\n**Well, I’m watching now.**\n\nAnd I won’t look away.\n\n---\n\nThis is the new frontier.\nSurvivor-led. Truth-driven. No compromise.\n\nIf this shook you —\ngood.\n\nNow *do* something with it.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Appreciate my work? Here’s how you can support it.**\n\nEverything I write — from exposés to reflections — is created independently, with no funding, no sponsors, and no backing. Just me, working across three platforms to share stories, challenge silence, and expose what others won’t.\n\nIf my work has moved you, informed you, or made you feel less alone — and you’d like to help me keep going — I’ve created a GoFundMe to support the growth and sustainability of this work.\n\n**Any support helps — whether it’s towards better equipment, secure hosting, emotional recovery, or just the time and space to keep telling the truth.**\n\nThere’s no pressure. Just deep gratitude for reading, sharing, and being here.\n\n[Support the work here.](https://gofund.me/96f0ba9b)\n*With love and fire — Soph* 🖤\n\n---","src/content/articles/three-days-with-a-predator-part-one.md","6c97d12d3ae73027",{"html":6483,"metadata":6484},"\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files | The Indie Leaks | @realtalkrealtea\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_editor_output_image53159558-1744851473008899534866174850232.jpg?w=466\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-message-that-changed-everything\">\u003Cstrong>The Message That Changed Everything\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I didn’t ask for this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve spent years researching predators, interviewing survivors, documenting cases, uncovering institutional rot.\nBut this was something else entirely.\n\u003Cstrong>This was direct contact.

No reasoning.\nJust a flat, confident yes.\n\nBut I didn’t believe him.\nBecause I’d heard what came before it.\nAnd because I’d seen what came after.\n\n---\n\n## **Is He Changed — Or Just Shamed?**\n\nI asked if he felt different now.\n\n> \n> *“Yes. Because I lost everything.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nNot *because I harmed someone.*\nNot *because I faced what I did.*\nBecause *he* lost something.\n\nThat’s not accountability.\nThat’s ego in ruins.\n\nI asked if he ever tried to justify it.\n\n> \n> *“No. Never.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nHe knew it was wrong.\nBut he still did it.\n\nHe didn’t claim ignorance.\nHe didn’t pretend confusion.\nHe just called it *“fun.”*\n\n---\n\n## **When the Past Becomes a Shield**\n\nThen came the line so many predators eventually reach for:\n\n> \n> *“I was abused too.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nIt landed like a whisper.\nNo follow-up. No pain. No connection to what he did.\n\nJust a fact — as if that explains it all.\n\nBut survivors know this truth:\nYour pain doesn’t give you the right to cause more.\n\n---\n\n## **The Final Question He Couldn't Answer**\n\nI asked him:\n\n> \n> *“If a child victim of abuse read this one day — what would you want them to take from your words?”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nHe replied:\n\n> \n> *“I really don’t know. That’s the truth.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nNot *“I’m sorry.”*\nNot *“You didn’t deserve it.”*\n\nJust *“I don’t know.”*\n\nAnd that’s where the interview ended in truth.\nNot with a confession.\nNot with closure.\nBut with exposure.\n\n---\n\n## **Reflection: What He Said — and What He Never Will**\n\nHe said:\n\n- *“I lost everything.”*\n\n- *“I want to be exposed.”*\n\n- *“I didn’t think.”*\n\nHe never said:\n\n- *“I hurt someone.”*\n\n- *“I’m sorry for what they went through.”*\n\n- *“I wish I could undo it.”*\n\nThat silence?\nIt’s louder than the words.\n\n---\n\n## **Why This Matters**\n\nBecause this is how predators speak when they think someone will listen.\n\nBecause these aren’t just one man’s words — they’re echoes of thousands.\n\nBecause understanding the mindset is the first step toward breaking the cycle.\n\nBecause if survivors like me don’t document it — who will?\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Appreciate my work?

During Recording**\n\n**Tredegar, Wales –** A dramatic confrontation unfolded this morning at **Roseland Bed & Breakfast**, where **Dank Dragon Exposure** confronted a man identified as **Daffyd Palfrey** over alleged inappropriate online activity.\n\nThe sting, **streamed live on social media**, quickly escalated when **Palfrey’s father physically attacked members of the group and made threats of gun violence.**\n\nAs tensions rose, **police arrived with three patrol cars and entered the property while the live recording was still ongoing.**\n\n---\n\n### **The Confrontation: Denial and Evidence**\n\nDank Dragon Exposure, a well-known group dedicated to **exposing online predators**, arrived at **Roseland B&B** to confront **Daffyd**, presenting what they claimed was **clear evidence** of inappropriate conversations.\n\nHowever, **Palfrey denied all allegations**, insisting he had been **hacked**—a **common defense often seen in similar cases.**\n\nAs a member of **Dank Dragon** continued questioning **Palfrey**, the situation **quickly escalated** when his **father came outside in an apparent rage.**\n\n---\n\n### **Violence, Shotgun Threats & Police Involvement**\n\nEyewitnesses watching the **live sting** saw **Palfrey’s father physically attack members of Dank Dragon.**\n\nDuring the altercation, he **threatened to “blow their heads off with a shotgun.”**\n\nShortly after, **three police cars arrived at the scene**, and **officers entered the property** while the **live recording continued.**\n\nAt this time, it is **unclear whether any arrests were made**, but **police intervention suggests that both the allegations against Palfrey and his father’s violent threats are now under investigation.**\n\n---\n\n### **Who Are Dank Dragon?**\n\nDank Dragon is an **independent group** that conducts **sting operations** to expose online predators.\n\nThey work with **decoys posing as minors**, gathering evidence and confronting individuals in **live-streamed stings.**\n\nWhile their actions have drawn **praise from supporters**, they have also faced **criticism** for potentially interfering with police investigations.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Exposure Teams Matter**\n\nThere is no question that **more needs to be done to keep children safe** from online predators.\n\n**Groups like Dank Dragon play a critical role in exposing those who seek to harm minors**—and their efforts are essential in a system where too many cases **slip through the cracks.**\n\nThe work of exposure teams should not be

Not because epilepsy is untreatable, but because the systems meant to keep them alive consistently fail to follow the most basic clinical standards. These deaths are not tragic mysteries — they are predictable outcomes of institutional neglect.***\n\n---\n\n## **We Already Understand Epilepsy. We Just Don’t Apply That Knowledge.**\n\nEpilepsy is not a mysterious condition. It is one of the most researched, most understood, most treatable neurological disorders in medicine. We know what causes seizures. We know how to prevent them. We know what increases the risk of sudden death. We have known these things for decades.\n\nAnd yet, according to the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman’s report published today, prisoners with epilepsy are dying at four times the rate of people in the community. Not because their condition is more severe. Not because prison healthcare lacks the tools to help them. But because the systems designed to keep them alive simply do not function.\n\nI have spent years documenting institutional failures—the ways our systems let vulnerable people fall through cracks that should never have existed. But this report represents something different. This is not a gap in the system. This is the system working exactly as designed: processing people rather than caring for them, managing risk on paper while ignoring it in practice.\n\n---\n\n## **Only 38% Had a Care Plan — This Is Not a Resource Problem**\n\nOnly 38% of prisoners with epilepsy had a documented care plan. This is not a resource problem. It is a priorities problem.\n\nConsider the simplest finding in the PPO’s research: only 38% of prisoners with an epilepsy diagnosis had a documented care plan. A care plan is a piece of paper. It costs nothing to produce. It requires no specialist equipment, no additional staffing, no budget allocation. It requires only that someone sit down and write: this person has epilepsy, these are their triggers, this is their medication, this is what to do in an emergency.\n\n62% of prisoners didn’t have this basic document. When they seized in their cells, staff had no guidance. When they transferred prisons, their medical history travelled as rumour rather than record. When they died, clinical reviewers could only note that care was not equivalent to that available in the community.\n\nThis is not a resource problem. It is a priorities problem. And it reflects a deeper truth about how we view people in prison: as problems to be managed, not patients to be treated.\n\n---\n\n## **A Woman Died in the Gaps Between Responsibilities**\n\nThe report documents a woman whose anti-seizure medication was reduced without adequate co-ordination with mental health services. She became severely anxious. She was placed on suicide watch. Healthcare staff never participated in her suicide prevention meetings. The doctor who reviewed her medication on the day she died didn’t know she was on an ACCT. She died by hanging.\n\nEvery failure in her case was a communication failure. The medication decision, the mental health impact, the suicide prevention protocol—each existed in its own silo, each managed by professionals who apparently never spoke to each other about the woman they were supposed to be helping. She died in the gaps between their responsibilities.\n\nThis siloed approach to human beings is not unique to prisons. I have seen it in every institution I have investigated. Social services that don’t talk to schools. Police that don’t share intelligence with child protection. Healthcare that exists on paper but not in practice. The result is always the same: people die, and everyone can point to someone else’s failure while absolving themselves of responsibility.\n\n---\n\n## **People in Prison Have No Alternatives**\n\nBut prisons are different in one crucial respect. People in prison have no alternative. They cannot choose a different GP if their needs aren’t being met. They cannot take themselves to A&E if they feel a seizure coming on. They cannot refuse a cell transfer that will disrupt their care. They are entirely dependent on an institution that the PPO’s research suggests cannot be depended upon.\n\nThe state made a choice to put these people in custody. That choice comes with obligations. The duty to provide healthcare equivalent to that in the community is not aspirational—it is a legal requirement. When 42% of prisoners who should have had annual epilepsy reviews didn’t receive them, when prisoners transferred without their medication, when seizure frequency increased without any monitoring or specialist referral, the state failed in its most basic duty of care.\n\nThese are not medical mysteries. They are bureaucratic homicides.\n\n---\n\n## **Seizure-Free Rates as Low as 0.2% — A System Not Functioning**\n\nI keep returning to one statistic from the report: in the community, up to 70% of people with epilepsy can live seizure-free with proper treatment. In prison, recent research found that figure as low as 0.2%. Not 2%. Not 0.2% difference. 0.2% total. That is not a failure to achieve excellence. That is a failure to function at all.\n\n---\n\n## **The PPO’s Recommendations Are Not Revolutionary — They Are Basic Competence**\n\nThe PPO’s recommendations are measured, practical, achievable. Ensure care plans exist. Follow medication protocols. Transfer prisoners with their medication. Don’t put people who have seizures on top bunks. These are not revolutionary demands. They are the bare minimum of competent care. That they need to be stated at all—that an Ombudsman must publish a bulletin reminding healthcare professionals to follow their own guidelines—tells us how normalised this neglect has become.\n\nPrisons will say they are overcrowded. They will say they are underfunded. They will say they are doing their best under difficult circumstances. All of this may be true. None of it excuses leaving 62% of prisoners with epilepsy without a care plan. None of it excuses the 34% of prisoners with epilepsy in this sample who died by suicide. None of it excuses the basic failures of communication, protocol and humanity documented in case after case.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that we do not actually believe prisoners deserve equivalent healthcare. We may say we do. We may have policies that claim we do. But when resources are scarce, when attention is divided, when difficult choices must be made, we consistently choose to provide prisoners with less. The PPO’s report is evidence of that choice, repeated across 125 deaths over 10 years.\n\n---\n\n## **These Were Preventable Deaths — Killed by Neglect, Not Epilepsy**\n\nThese were not complicated cases. Epilepsy is manageable. SUDEP is largely preventable. The prisoners in this report died because care plans weren’t written, because medications weren’t transferred, because seizures weren’t monitored, because officers weren’t trained, because protocols weren’t followed. They died from paperwork failures and communication breakdowns and institutional indifference.\n\nThey died, in other words, from our choices. From our collective decision that their lives mattered less, that their healthcare could be deprioritised, that their deaths would be acceptable losses in a system designed to warehouse rather than rehabilitate.\n\n---\n\n## **We Know What Needs to Change. The Question Is Whether We Care Enough.**\n\nThe PPO will work with NHS England and HMPPS on recommendations. Lessons will be learned. Actions will be formulated. And in ten years, another Ombudsman will likely publish another bulletin documenting another decade of preventable deaths.\n\nUnless we decide differently. Unless we decide that a prisoner with epilepsy deserves a care plan. That a medication protocol exists to be followed, not filed. That a transfer should include the medication the prisoner needs to survive. That a seizure is a medical emergency even if the patient has used drugs. That sleeping alone is a risk factor worth addressing. That a person remains a patient even when they are also a prisoner.\n\nThese are small decisions. They require no legislation, no budget increase, no policy revolution. They require only that we treat incarcerated people as human beings worthy of basic medical care. The PPO has shown us exactly where we are failing and exactly what needs to change.\n\nThe only question now is whether we care enough to do it.\n\n---\n\n*Sophie Lewis is an NUJ-accredited investigative journalist and founder of The Grooming Files.

Trauma Doesn't.\n\nCourt proceedings are finite.\n\nTrauma is not.\n\nFor many survivors of organised child sexual exploitation, the trial marks the moment when institutional interest quietly evaporates.\n\nThe case is \"dealt with\".\nFiles are closed.\nSupport tapers off.\n\nAnd the girls, now young women.. are left to carry the aftermath alone.\n\n---\n\n## Rotherham: What the Jay Report Found Years Later\n\nThe 2014 Jay Report into Rotherham didn't just document the abuse.\n\nIt documented what happened to survivors afterwards.\n\nMany had developed:\n\n- severe psychological problems\n\n- patterns of self-harm\n\n- suicidal ideation and attempts\n\n- drug and alcohol dependencies\n\n- difficulties parenting their own children\n\nThe abuse ended.\n\nThe consequences didn't.\n\nAnd the support they received was never designed to address trauma of this scale or duration.\n\n---\n\n## Support That Expires Too Early\n\nIn theory, victims are offered support.\n\nIn practice, it is often:\n\n- short-term\n\n- fragmented\n\n- poorly coordinated\n\n- withdrawn once proceedings conclude\n\nCounselling ends.\nAdvocacy services move on.\nSpecialist provision disappears.\n\nThe expectation, spoken or not.. is that justice has been done, and healing should follow.\n\nBut trauma doesn't operate on legal timetables.\n\n---\n\n## From Victim to Problem — Again\n\nOne of the most uncomfortable realities is this:\n\n**Many survivors are later criminalised.**\n\nNot for the abuse they endured  but for the ways they coped with it.\n\nSubstance use.\nRisk-taking.\nMental health crises.\nAnger.\nDissociation.\n\nInstead of being recognised as trauma responses, these behaviours are often treated as personal failure.\n\nThe same girls once labelled \"vulnerable\" become:\n\n- \"chaotic\"\n\n- \"non-compliant\"\n\n- \"offenders\"\n\nThe system that failed to protect them the first time frequently meets them again, this time through policing, probation, or crisis services.\n\n---\n\n## The Myth of 'Resilience'\n\nSurvivors are often praised for their resilience.\n\nBut resilience has become a convenient euphemism for abandonment.\n\nIt allows institutions to admire survival without addressing why survival was necessary in the first place.\n\nIt avoids the harder truth:\n\nThat many victims were pushed into adulthood carrying complex trauma, with minimal long-term support, and unrealistic expectations placed on their recovery.\n\n---\n\n## Where Accountability Quietly Ends\n\nOnce perpetrators are convicted, accountability tends to stop there.\n\nRarely examined are:\n\n- the professionals who missed repeated disclosures\n\n- the agencies that downgraded risk\n\n- the safeguarding thresholds that weren't met\n\n- the institutional cultures that enabled silence\n\nThe harm is individualised.\nThe failure is not.\n\nVictims are expected to rebuild their lives whilst the structures that failed them remain largely intact.\n\n---\n\n## Those Who Never Saw a Courtroom\n\nAnother truth is even harder to face.\n\nNot all perpetrators were charged.\n\nNot all offences met evidential thresholds.\n\nNot all victims were believed.\n\nFor many survivors, the trial that brought \"closure\" for the public represented only a fraction of what happened to them and a fraction of who was responsible.\n\nJustice, for them, was partial at best.\n\n---\n\n## What Real Aftercare Would Look Like\n\nIf safeguarding systems were serious about long-term protection, they would recognise that the aftermath matters as much as the prosecution.\n\nReal aftercare would include:\n\n- guaranteed long-term trauma support\n\n- continuity of specialist services beyond trials\n\n- protection from criminalisation of trauma responses\n\n- accountability reviews that centre victim outcomes, not institutional process\n\nInstead, survivors are often left navigating adulthood with a fractured sense of safety and a deep mistrust of the systems that once asked them to speak.\n\n---\n\n## The Ending Nobody Writes About\n\nGrooming gang trials are often framed as endings.\n\nThey're not.\n\nThey are transitions from visible harm to quieter, longer-lasting consequences.\n\nIf we keep treating convictions as the finish line, we will keep failing the people who paid the highest price for the abuse and the silence that followed.\n\nJustice doesn't end when a sentence is handed down.\n\nFor survivors, that's often when they realise how alone they still are.\n\n---\n\n**Sophie Lewis |

It builds on my 2025 Five Part Series exposé. But this time it's personal. *\n\n---\n\n**I was barely 8 years old when a man told me I was beautiful in a MSN chatroom.**\n\nI didn’t see danger. I saw excitement. I saw attention. I saw someone noticing me.\nLooking back, that moment changed everything.\n\nWe were the first kids online.\nDial-up tones. MSN Messenger. Webcams balanced on bulky monitors.\nNo rules. No warnings. No one watching.\n\nAnd the predators?\nThey found us before our parents even knew what a USB was.\n\nThey met us in chatrooms.\nKids Chat. AOL. MSN, Yahoo. We’d log in at 9, say we were 14, and before long we’d be hearing:\n“What you wearing?”\n“You’re cute.”\n“Show me.”\n\nThey showed themselves too.\nMen in their 30s. 40s. 60s.\nNot 16. Not 18. ***Fully Grown Men***.\n\n**Just let that sink in a minute... **\n\nThey told us we were special. Mature. Beautiful.\nAnd we believed them — because no one told us not to.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000bcfc623096564acf64085ec2_conversation_id3d67ef8bd1-d7f8-8002-bb69-a196cda329de26message_id3de913c0f9-dc7b-4d57-ab16-05b65d4af99b7756765946289761150.jpg?w=683)\n\n---\n\n### **It Didn’t Feel Like Grooming. It Felt Like Attention.**\n\nIt felt like excitement. Like thrill. Like fear we didn’t understand.\nLike shame that still knots in our stomachs decades later.\n\nWe started meeting them.\nMen with cars. Men with alcohol. Men who didn’t need to take us — we went.\nWe lied about our ages, because that’s what girls did. We said we were 16 when we were 13.\n\nBut the truth?\nWe looked 10. And they knew it.\n\nWe thought we loved it.\nThat’s what they made us believe. That wasn’t consent — that was **childhood confusion, weaponised**.\n\nIt became so normal, it was daily.\nAnd the damage was done before we even knew we were bleeding.\n\n---\n\n### **“Ben” Could’ve Killed Me**\n\nHe offered me a lift once when I was with friends. Pakistani or Indian — I wasn’t sure.\nWe’d seen him around. The next time, I went alone.\n\nHe picked me up. Drove me somewhere remote.\nDark. Silent. I remember how heavy the air was.\n\nHe tried to kiss me. Grabbed me. Pushed. Pressured.\n\nI froze. But I lied — faked a call, said my sister was tracking me, said my location out loud.\n\nMaybe that scared him. Maybe it didn’t. But he drove me back.\nAnd the second the car slowed near my estate, I jumped out and ran like hell.\n\nBecause I truly believed — if I hadn’t — **he would’ve raped me. Or worse.** **Killed me! **\n\n---\n\n### **20 Men. Two Girls. No Way Out.**\n\nJ said she knew them. “They’re alright,” she told me. “It’s fine.”\nThey were Nigerian. Picked us up. Took us to a house.\n\nWhen we walked in?\nMore than twenty men. All older. All staring.\n\nWe were offered drinks. I told J not to take it. She did anyway.\n\nThen we were moved. New house. Same two men.\nUpstairs. Into a bedroom.\n\nIt became clear, fast — **this wasn’t a hangout. This was a setup.**\n\nI grabbed J’s arm and said, “We’re going.”\n\nWe ran. Shoved past them. Jumped over bodies on the stairs.\nFlew out the door like our lives depended on it — because they probably did.\n\nWe were barely fourteen.\n\n---\n\n### **They Said We Were Naughty Girls**\n\nI tried to speak out. Told someone. Cracked open the truth.\n\nThey didn’t believe me.\nWorse — they blamed me.\n\n“You loved the attention.”\n“It’s your fault.”\n“You were asking for it.”\n\nEven now, when I talk to girls I grew up with, they ask:\n“Was it really grooming?”\n“We were naughty, weren’t we?”\n“Did that really happen to us?”\n\n**Yes.

Into adulthood.\nInto breakdowns and addiction.\nInto trust issues and triggered silences.\nInto that voice in our head that still asks,\n“Why can’t I just get over it?”\n\nAnd still — it’s rare anyone calls it what it was.\n\nBecause we didn’t get groomed today, with safeguarding and public outrage.\nWe got groomed **then** — in the wild west of the internet,\nwhen people thought it was just “girls being flirty.”\n\nNo one saw us as victims.\nSo we didn’t know we were.\n\n---\n\n### **Even Now, We Doubt Ourselves**\n\nThat’s the legacy.\nNot just trauma — but doubt.\n\nWe still hear the voices in our heads:\n“Was it really that bad?”\n“We went along with it, didn’t we?”\n“We lied about our age though…”\n\nWe repeat the lies we were fed.\nWe laugh when we talk about it, because we don’t know what else to do.\nWe swap horror stories like they’re throwaway memories.\n\nBut deep down?\nWe know we weren’t wild.\n**We were unprotected.**\n\nAnd that’s what hurts the most —\nthat we’ve had to live this long wondering if we did this to ourselves.\n\n**We didn’t.**\n\n---\n\n### **This Never Stopped — It Just Got Easier**\n\nPredators didn’t disappear when the dial-up tone died.\nThey evolved — just like the tech did.\n\nNow they don’t need AOL chatrooms.\nThey’re on Kik, Snapchat. TikTok. Discord. Instagram.\nFake names. Disappearing messages.

Brown is now free to resume his world tour. The court, it seems, was confident he posed no risk worth denying his liberty.\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000e38461f8be1e3a6e5f012a1b281292700420652966178844.jpg?w=1024)\n\nContrast that with a case closer to the ground, involving a young man from South Wales. We'll call him \"Jay.\"\n\nJay received a call out of the blue. He was being recalled to prison for a driving offence.

Not because they lack urgency — but because the boy who lived them didn’t know he was allowed to speak.\n\nIn our last article, *The Silent Struggle*, we explored the shame and systemic silence that surround male survivors of grooming. This piece goes deeper: into the cost of that silence. Into the ripple effect of what happens when boys stay quiet until they become men.\n\nThis is the story of **delayed disclosure** — and why it matters more than most people realise.\n\n---\n\n## **He Was 11 When It Started.**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000003710620aa1d1faafed5646d65883593072326032253.png?w=683)\n\nHis name doesn’t matter. What matters is that he was quiet, kind, and trusted the adult who took him home from football practice. It happened more than once. Then it stopped — but nothing really stopped.\n\nFor thirty years, he never told a soul.\n\nBecause no one asked.\nBecause boys don’t cry.\nBecause he didn’t even realise it was abuse until the word “grooming” entered the headlines — long after the damage was done.\n\n---\n\n## **Why Didn’t He Speak Sooner?**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000092e8620ab3eb779c9334ec0a4222045759628311805.png?w=1024)\n\nWhen a boy is abused, the moment it ends is rarely the moment it stops affecting him. For many, the abuse is buried. Disguised as confusion, anger, risk-taking. Sometimes it’s sexualised, sometimes it's shamed into silence. And sometimes, it’s reframed as something he chose.\n\nMasculinity doesn’t make space for male vulnerability. And so the survivor builds walls instead of words.\n\n> \n> *\"I didn't know I could say anything. I thought it would make me look weak. I thought people would think I wanted it.\" — A male survivor, age 41*\n> \n> \n> \n\nHe hinted once, as a teenager, with a joke that made his friend uncomfortable. He pulled away from a partner who touched his shoulder “the wrong way.” He went years without sleep. But disclosure didn’t come. Because nobody stayed long enough to see past the surface.\n\n---\n\n## **The Price of Silence**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000a17c620a837a7ea11c0bab5f3492616371596369511.png?w=1024)\n\nDelayed disclosure doesn’t mean the trauma disappears. It just means it hides — in the body, the brain, and the behaviours.\n\n**Psychological effects include:**\n\n- Depression and anxiety\n\n- PTSD\n\n- Emotional dysregulation\n\n- Shame and self-blame\n\n**Physical consequences can include:**\n\n- Chronic illness\n\n- Sleep disruption\n\n- Headaches and gut problems linked to stress\n\n**Social impacts:**\n\n- Struggles forming intimate relationships\n\n- Trouble with authority or maintaining employment\n\n- Isolation or difficulty expressing emotions\n\nHe drank to sleep. He cheated to feel control. He shut people out before they could ask questions.\n\nA 2023 study in the *Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law* found that men who were groomed in childhood and delayed disclosure had significantly higher rates of substance misuse, suicidal ideation, and complex trauma symptoms.\n\nThe impact isn’t just internal — it follows them into every part of adult life.\n\n---\n\n## **The Cost to Relationships**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000a3986246ae61864701d934ff30851360723887716.png?w=1024)\n\nMany male survivors enter adulthood carrying an invisible wound. Partners may feel them pulling away emotionally. They may avoid physical affection or swing between hypersexuality and shutdown. Trust becomes fragile. Communication collapses. And often, they have no words for why.\n\n> \n> *“I didn’t even know it had anything to do with what happened back then. I just thought I was broken.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nHe ghosted his girlfriend the day after she told him she loved him. Not because he didn’t feel it — but because he didn’t know how to hold it.\n\nFamilies are affected too. Some men become distant fathers, absent brothers, or emotionally unavailable sons — not because they don’t care, but because they’ve spent years trying to stay numb.\n\n---\n\n## **The Missed Signs**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000006f6c6246add50c1b9250c3207407340391459275897.png?w=1024)\n\nDisclosure doesn’t usually come as a full story. It starts with a signal. A whisper. A test.\n\n- A joke about something that “happened once.”\n\n- A change in behaviour around certain people or places.\n\n- Sudden anxiety, aggression, or withdrawal.\n\n- Fear of specific genders, ages, or authority figures.\n\nTeachers saw him as disruptive. His GP gave him sleeping pills. A social worker marked him down as “angry and defiant.”\n\nNobody asked what happened *before* the behaviour.\n\nSafeguarding systems often fail to see male-specific trauma responses. But these moments — these whispers — are where intervention could save years of pain.\n\n---\n\n## **When He Finally Speaks**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000c624620a911a29e071b11cd98056683667308276156.png?w=683)\n\nHe didn’t plan to say it. It came out in a routine GP appointment, somewhere between blood pressure checks and breathlessness.\n\n> \n> *“I think someone did something to me... when I was younger.”*\n> \n> \n> \n\nAnd then he cried for two days straight.\n\nSome men disclose in therapy. Others to their partners. Some anonymously, online. But the first time it’s said — even silently typed — is a crack in the wall. A beginning.\n\nFor some, it brings relief. For others, it triggers chaos. Both are valid. Healing is not linear.\n\n---\n\n## **What If He Was Heard Sooner?**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000d2dc6246ac47e1d837e45a56_conversation_id3d68016b3d-6850-8002-9c00-e528503a5dc826message_id3d7c1f223b-f211-4d6d-9d6d-c1d6035af9724616168180819877905.jpg?w=1024)\n\nThis is the question we must ask. Because every boy who is dismissed, ignored, or disbelieved becomes a man carrying trauma alone.\n\nWhat if his first disclosure wasn’t minimised?\nWhat if the systems — schools, police, doctors — responded with trauma-informed understanding?\nWhat if media stopped calling abuse of boys “affairs” or “scandals” and named it for what it is?\n\nThese “what ifs” should be turned into *what now.*\n\n---\n\n## **Breaking the Delay: What Needs to Change**\n\n- **Early education** — Teach all children, regardless of gender, what grooming is and how to seek help.\n\n- **Male-focused services** — Fund and promote survivor spaces that are safe for men and boys.\n\n- **Cultural change** — Dismantle toxic masculinity and redefine strength as truth-telling, not silence.\n\n- **Professional training** — Ensure all frontline workers are trained to recognise male trauma responses.\n\n- **Media responsibility** — Challenge how male victims are represented and push back on minimising language.\n\n---\n\n## **To the One Still Holding It In**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000aa84620aa6c003940589c7f19031373923433029560.png?w=1024)\n\nIf you’re a man who never spoke — or who spoke and was shut down — know this:\n\nYou deserved protection. You deserved belief. You still do.\n\nIt’s not too late. You are not too broken. And you are not alone.\n\nYou don’t have to tell the world. You don’t have to tell your name. You just have to know: your story matters.\n\nAnd when you’re ready to say it, even quietly — we’ll be here.\n\n*The Grooming Files.*\n\n---","src/content/articles/what-if-he-spoke-up-sooner.md","b19d9d96abe4fb7a",{"html":7265,"metadata":7266},"\u003Cp>©️ By Sophie Lewis - The Grooming Files | The Indie Leaks | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000002074620aaf7c954585ecd9ab1821403784198792101.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"how-delayed-disclosure-is-still-costing-male-survivors-everything\">\u003Cstrong>How delayed disclosure is still costing male survivors everything\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There are stories that take decades to be told.

Or so I thought.\n\nI sat there after it all ended — after the spiralling, the contradictions, the apologies, the emotional swings — and just stared. I couldn’t tell if I’d uncovered something huge or been pulled into something broken.\n\nBecause what he gave me wasn’t just an interview. It was a psychological collapse, caught in real time.\nAnd somehow, through all of it, I became the one carrying the weight.\n\n---\n\n## *The Breakdown of the Chaos*\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_0000000011c861f79e9601f4c7aee97e_conversation_id3d68019bf0-0dcc-8002-b978-7f9ed75fcb2226message_id3d5706125b-c517-4079-bf3f-0582836e37ed2700023826192962854.jpg?w=683)\n\nIt started with a message:\n**“I want to be exposed. I want people to know what I did.”**\n\nHe came to me, unprompted, and admitted to messaging underage children online. He said he was on the barred list. He told me he deserved to be named. He gave consent — in writing — and said it multiple times across multiple platforms.\n\nSo I believed him.\n\nI asked questions. He answered — slowly, vaguely, sometimes spinning off into distraction, but still answering. He agreed to an interview. Then he bailed after the first question. Hours later, he came back and said he was ready. So I interviewed him — seventeen minutes of answers, dodges, pauses, confessions.\n\nAnd then… the spiral began.\n\n**“Can you leave an emoji on my face?”**\n**“Please don’t say the word ‘paedophile’ — it’s harsh.”**\n**“You’re not going to call me that, are you?”**\n**“I just wanted to be hated.”**\n**“I made it all up.”**\n**“I’m broken.”**\n**“You got your story.”**\n**“You’ve won.”**\n**“Do you still want to speak to me?”**\n**“I’m a clown.”**\n\nAt one point, he begged me not to use the term “grooming,” even though it was *his own word* in our original message exchange. He told me he wanted “peace,” but kept messaging. He asked me to change the platform I released it on. He told me he was scared. Then he offered to donate to my GoFundMe — as if that would somehow reset the scale.a\n\nWHAT THE FUCK? \n\nThere was no through-line, no single truth. Just emotional whiplash dressed up as vulnerability.\n\nAnd yet… he never denied the messaging. Not once.\n\nNot clearly. Not directly.\nHe just twisted. Softened. Guilt-tripped. Delayed.\n\nUntil I didn’t know if I was interviewing a predator or watching a man unravel.\n\nAnd that — right there — is what made this so dangerous.\n\n---\n\n## **When Predators **Play** Vi**ctim\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000d2dc6246ac47e1d837e45a56_conversation_id3d68016b3d-6850-8002-9c00-e528503a5dc826message_id3d7c1f223b-f211-4d6d-9d6d-c1d6035af9725176480638712559193.jpg?w=1024)\n\nHe never raised his voice.\nHe didn’t lash out. He didn’t deny what he’d said — not at first.\nHe came in soft. Friendly. A little broken. The kind of tone that makes you want to lean in, not back away.\n\nIt wasn’t a threat.\nIt was a trap dressed as a whisper.\n\nHe told me he was ready. Told me he’d been on the barred list. Said he knew he was wrong. Said he didn’t deserve anonymity. That he wanted people to know.\n\nAnd then came the slow slippage.\n\nHe made it sound like I was running a campaign against him. Like *I* was the aggressor — not the one sitting up late at night, trying to carry the emotional weight of every message he sent. Like I was *taking advantage* of a man who was just trying to be honest.\n\nBut what he was really doing… was reclaiming control.\n\nWhen he couldn’t control the narrative, he shifted.\nWhen guilt didn’t work, he tried shame.\nWhen shame didn’t work, he tried pity.\nAnd when pity didn’t work, he tried silence — but only long enough to make me second-guess myself.\n\nThis is what predators do when they lose the room.\nThey play soft. They play scared. They make you feel like the bad guy for not softening.\n\nBut here’s the thing: **I never hunted him. He came to me. He confessed. And when the mirror started reflecting too clearly, he panicked.**\n\n---\n\n## **Survivor Guilt and Gut Instincts**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file-6ctcrrqqjuxvfehgmsiuch9214634945762454657.jpg?w=1024)\n\nI know how it sounds.\nI know what people might say: *“Why are you doubting yourself?”*\n*“He confessed.”*\n*“He agreed to everything.”*\nBut when you’ve lived through abuse, when you’ve survived the hands and the silence and the shame — you don’t just walk into confrontation without checking your reflection a hundred times first.\n\nBecause survivors carry **hyper-awareness**.\nWe scan for danger — but also for guilt.\nWe question ourselves *even when we’re right*. Especially when we’re right.\n\nThere was a moment — maybe the third time he begged for his face to be blurred — when something cracked in me.\nI thought: *What if he’s just broken? What if I destroy someone who doesn’t deserve it?*\nAnd right behind that thought came the darker one:\n*What if this is exactly what he wants me to feel?*\n\nBecause that’s what it felt like — a psychological test. A manipulation so slow it didn’t even sting. It just seeped. And it worked, for a second. I doubted myself. I questioned everything. I lay there wondering if I’d gone too far, if I was now the one doing harm.\n\nBut then I remembered the timeline.\nThe screenshots.\nThe video.\nThe voice notes.\nThe fact that **he said it all.**\n\nI didn’t put those words in his mouth.\nI just documented them.\nAnd I’m not going to feel guilty for holding someone to the weight of their own confession.\n\n---\n\n## **The Reckoning and the Mic Drop**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_0000000047f4620ab033ccde62638c46_conversation_id3d67ff1075-137c-8002-91f1-add16916d46226message_id3df3f4b437-3753-4c4c-b828-d6f6ddc185994144892871883076486.jpg?w=1024)\n\nI still don’t know who he is. Not really.\nI don’t know if he was telling the truth about the barred list.\nI don’t know if he ever got charged.\nI don’t even know if he fully knows who *he* is.\n\nBut I do know this:\n\n**He messaged me.**\n**He confessed to grooming.**\n**He agreed to be exposed.**\n**He gave consent — multiple times, in writing.**\n**And when I followed through, he panicked.**\n\nHe begged for edits. For protection. For softness.\nHe backtracked, spiralled, manipulated, and cried — not once for the children he claimed to have messaged, but for himself. For *his* face. *His* image. *His* shame.\n\nThis isn’t about whether he’s a paedophile.\nThis is about the fact that **he knew how to act like one**.\nHow to confess like one.\nHow to manipulate like one.\nAnd how to *reframe the entire thing* to make himself look like the victim.\n\nThis is what they do.\nAnd this — *this right here* — is why I published it.\n\nNot to ruin a man.\nTo **warn a generation**.\n\nSo yeah… what the fuck just happened?\n\n**You watched the whole blueprint.**\nYou watched him try to reshape the truth with every message.\nYou watched me walk the tightrope between morality and survival.\nYou watched it all fall apart — and still, somehow, hold.\n\nI’m not here to make him a monster.\nI’m here to make the pattern impossible to ignore.\n\n**And I’ll do it again.**\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer**: *His face remains covered.*\n*Not because he deserves protection — but because I don’t need to show it to tell the truth. The danger isn’t just in his identity. It’s in the pattern. The manipulation. The way it all unfolded. This was never about revenge — it was about reckoning. And I’ve done that, with or without the blur.*\n\n---\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/real_talk_profile_pic_circle_adjusted1187018690134226726.png?w=400)\n\n---\n\n**Appreciate my work?

We’ve had campaigns. We’ve worn the ribbons.\n\nBut children are still being abused. Every day.\nBecause **real prevention doesn’t come from being shocked**,** it comes from doing the work.**\n\nAnd that work begins long before a disclosure.\nLong before a court case.\nLong before a hashtag.\n\nReal prevention is proactive. Messy. Ongoing.\nAnd most of all, it’s uncomfortable. Because it asks adults to act before harm occurs.\n\n---\n\n## Prevention Starts With Conversations\n\nChildren don’t just need to know what *not* to do.\nThey need to know:\n\n- What their body boundaries are\n\n- What’s appropriate and what’s not\n\n- What to do if someone breaks those boundaries\n\n- That they will be *believed* if they speak up\n\nThat means **age-appropriate, honest conversations**. Not fear-based warnings or vague euphemisms.\n\nStart young. Use proper language.\nUse books, visuals, scenarios. Repeat the messages often.\n\nPrevention isn’t a one-off chat. It’s a culture you create.\n\n---\n\n## Education Must Go Beyond Stranger Danger\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000002d5c6246baadcc4158b88e901229577167544200007.png?w=1024)\n\nStill today, most child protection education focuses on *strangers*.\nBut as we’ve seen throughout this series, most abuse is committed by someone the child knows.\n\nThat’s why real prevention must include:\n\n- **Understanding grooming** — what it is, how it feels, how it hides\n\n- **Secret culture** — when someone says “don’t tell,” that’s a red flag\n\n- **Online safety** — not just screen limits, but emotional awareness\n\n- **Gender-neutral warnings** — boys are targets too, and girls can be offenders\n\n- **Body autonomy** — children have a right to say no, even to hugs\n\nWe must stop preparing children for rare scenarios while leaving them vulnerable to common ones.\n\n---\n\n## Adults Need to Be Educated Too\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_0000000002d86243b91f660af69bf8058299026871668721343.png?w=683)\n\nIt’s not children’s job to prevent abuse, it’s ours.\nBut too many adults:\n\n- Miss the red flags\n\n- Excuse inappropriate behaviour\n\n- Doubt disclosures because of who the accused is\n\n- Struggle with their own unhealed trauma\n\nThat’s why adult education is **just as essential** as child education.\n\nEvery parent, teacher, carer, coach, and youth worker should understand:\n\n- How abuse presents in behaviour, not just words\n\n- How to respond supportively to a disclosure\n\n- That grooming doesn’t look “evil” — it looks *charming*\n\n- That reacting calmly is key to keeping a child talking\n\n- That early intervention can *stop* cycles before they grow\n\n---\n\n## Believing Is Prevention\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000d35c6243abdae9f547e24e3e2912184004902629990.png?w=1024)\n\nToo often, children drop hints and we miss them.\nOr they say something outright and we question it.\n\n“Are you sure?”\n“Don’t say things like that.”\n“That doesn’t sound like them.”\n“Maybe you misunderstood.”\n\nBut belief is **the most powerful protective tool we have.**\n\nBecause when a child sees that adults take them seriously, they’re more likely to speak.\nAnd when children speak early, abusers lose power.\n\n---\n\n## Systems Need to Change Too\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000004b60620a9f9a4466a61124ab218797697512634888.png?w=683)\n\nIt’s not just personal prevention, it’s systemic.\n\nThat means:\n\n- **Mandatory safeguarding training** in all schools and youth spaces\n\n- **Easier reporting systems** that protect children, not reputations\n\n- **Multi-agency responses** that don’t leave children waiting months for action\n\n- **Accountability within institutions** when they ignore or mishandle disclosures\n\n- **Resources for survivor-parents**, so trauma doesn’t echo through generations\n\nPrevention isn’t a programme. It’s a principle.\nIt must live in our homes, schools, policies, and platforms.\n\n---\n\n## A Culture Shift Is the Goal\n\nWe need a culture where:\n\n- Children are believed before they’re broken\n\n- Survivors are heard without shame\n\n- Offenders are stopped without delay\n\n- Prevention is constant, not reactive\n\n- Silence isn’t normal — and secrets don’t win\n\nThat culture doesn’t start with governments.\nIt starts with us.\n\nEvery home. Every conversation. Every choice to speak, even when it’s hard.\n\n---\n\n## This series began with a truth:\n**We say we want to protect children — but we still avoid the conversations that matter most.**\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000711461f4884a3d9b89913bc46419333344792948857.png?w=1024)\n\nNow, there’s no excuse. We know better. We’ve seen the patterns.\nIt’s time to act before harm, not just after.\n\nBecause real prevention?\n\nIt’s not the badge.\nIt’s not the panic.\nIt’s not the policy paper on the shelf.\n\n**It’s the courage to name what we were taught to avoid and the choice to protect, even when it’s messy.**\n\nChildren are watching.\nLet’s show them we mean it.\n\n---\n\n**This is Part 8 and the final chapter of the ‘What We’re Still Not Talking About’ series.**\n\n---","src/content/articles/what-real-prevention-actually-looks-like.md","223b8513dbe95a28",{"html":7365,"metadata":7366},"\u003Cp>© By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000002de8624697d589f6446fd19d7982165759987482859.png?w=683\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"moving-beyond-awareness-into-action--a-survivor-led-guide-to-protecting-children-before-harm-happens\">\u003Cem>Moving beyond awareness into action — a survivor-led guide to protecting children before harm happens.\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"awareness-isnt-enough-anymore\">Awareness Isn’t Enough Anymore\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>We’ve raised awareness.

It’s complicated.\nAnd it doesn’t fit the “abuser vs victim” image that society prefers.\n\nBut it’s real. And it’s more common than anyone wants to admit.\n\n---\n\n## Peer-on-Peer Abuse Is Not “Curiosity”\n\nLet’s be clear: there is a world of difference between innocent curiosity and sexual abuse.\n\nExploring boundaries is part of development.\nBut **crossing them** — with coercion, force, manipulation, or shame — is not.\nAnd it happens more than we think.\n\nChildren who harm other children sexually are often:\n\n- Older, more physically or emotionally dominant\n\n- Mimicking behaviours they’ve been exposed to\n\n- Testing boundaries in unsafe or unmonitored environments\n\n- Using control to gain a sense of power or safety\n\nIt’s not always “malicious.” Sometimes it’s born from confusion, exposure, or trauma.\nBut it *is* abuse — and it has real, lasting consequences.\n\n---\n\n## Sibling Abuse: The Taboo Within the Home\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000008c10620a8bef5e1dd37afac45893353812337422441.png?w=683)\n\nSibling abuse is possibly the most silenced of all.\n\nWhen sexual harm happens between brothers and sisters — or between step-siblings — families often:\n\n- Deny it\n\n- Minimise it (“they’re just kids”)\n\n- Hide it\n\n- Fail to support *either* child properly\n\nSometimes, the parents don’t even know how to respond.\nOther times, they choose to protect the family image instead of facing the truth.\n\nBut the reality is:\n\n- The child who was harmed may carry trauma for life\n\n- The child who caused harm may have been harmed themselves\n\n- Both need support — not silence\n\nThe absence of proper response allows shame, fear, and confusion to take root.\nAnd both children can grow up haunted by what happened — and what was never addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Where Are the Safeguards?\n\nPeer-on-peer sexual abuse doesn’t just happen at home. It can occur:\n\n- In schools\n\n- In foster care placements\n\n- In youth groups or institutions\n\n- Between friends\n\n- On sleepovers or during unsupervised play\n\nToo often, the adults around are either unaware, unequipped, or unwilling to act.\n\nIn some cases, schools have brushed it off.\nIn others, social workers have struggled to respond without causing further harm.\nAnd in too many homes, it’s never spoken of again.\n\nThe lack of protocols — or the fear of labelling a child “an abuser” — means **intervention comes too late, if at all.**\n\n---\n\n## Children Can Cause Harm — and Still Be Children\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file-gxnhg5fasxxddycb2qypnv2539683862175144180.jpg?w=1024)\n\nThis truth is hard to hold:\n**A child who harms another child sexually is still a child.**\n\nThat doesn’t mean we excuse the behaviour.\nBut it does mean we respond with understanding, not punishment alone.\n\nMany children who act out sexually have:\n\n- Been abused themselves\n\n- Been exposed to pornography too early\n\n- Lacked boundaries and emotional safety\n\n- Been left in chaotic or neglectful environments\n\nThis isn’t just about stopping abuse. It’s about **understanding its ripple effects** — and interrupting them before they spread.\n\n---\n\n## The Long-Term Impact\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000000afc6243b97fa28b350fd51e7140870696012430708.png?w=1024)\n\nSurvivors of peer or sibling abuse often feel uniquely isolated.\nThey may struggle with:\n\n- Confusion about what happened (“was it really abuse?”)\n\n- Fear of disrupting the family or being blamed\n\n- A deep sense of shame\n\n- Sexual dysfunction or identity issues later in life\n\nMany don’t speak up until adulthood — and when they do, the response is often:\n“But they were just a kid.”\nOr worse:\n“You need to let that go.”\n\nBut trauma doesn’t vanish just because the person who caused it was young.\n\n---\n\n## What Prevention *Really* Looks Like\n\nTrue prevention means early, age-appropriate conversations and safer environments for all children — especially those already vulnerable.\n\nIt means:\n\n- Educating children on boundaries, consent, and private vs public behaviour\n\n- Training teachers, carers, and parents to spot warning signs\n\n- Creating space for disclosures without blame or disbelief\n\n- Understanding that children who cause harm need intervention, not demonisation\n\nWe must build systems that respond with *nuance and care* — not denial and shame.\n\n---\n\n## Child-on-child sexual abuse doesn’t fit our preferred narratives.\n\n### But it is real.\nAnd it matters.\n\nIf we keep brushing it off as a phase — or avoiding it because it’s too uncomfortable — we abandon the children at the centre of it.\n\nSome are harmed.\nSome are harming.\nAnd too many are left unheard, unsupported, and permanently affected.\n\nIt’s time we faced this one.\n\nBecause silence only lets the cycle continue.\n\n---\n\n**This is Part 4 of the ‘What We’re Still Not Talking About’ series.**\n\nRead the main article here:[What We're Still Not Talking About ](http://thegroomingfiles.com/2025/05/10/what-were-still-not-talking-about/)\n\n---","src/content/articles/when-children-harm-children-the-hidden-reality-of-sibling-and-peer-on-peer-abuse.md","031c5da38b23badb",{"html":7492,"metadata":7493},"\u003Cp>© By Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files | @sophielewiseditorial\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file-5bceygmkjpk1tzljza7cn44385720732026658405.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-deep-dive-into-one-of-the-most-silenced-and-misunderstood-forms-of-child-sexual-abuse\">\u003Cem>A deep dive into one of the most silenced and misunderstood forms of child sexual abuse.\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"nobody-wants-to-talk-about-this-one\">Nobody Wants to Talk About This One\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Out of all the forms of child sexual abuse, this is the one that gets avoided the most:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>When the abuser is another child.\u003C/strong>\nWhen it happens between siblings.\nWhen the family doesn’t know how to respond — or doesn’t want to believe it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s messy.

early and extreme example of vigilante-style targeting occurred in October 2015, when 42-year-old lorry driver Darren Kelly from Basildon was killed following online accusations. A teenage girl had initiated what was described as a personal campaign against suspected paedophiles, recruiting others including 20-year-old Chris Carroll. Kelly was beaten and fatally stabbed with a hunting knife.\n\nEssex Police later confirmed what made this case particularly disturbing: Darren Kelly was entirely innocent. Police stated there was \"no evidence he was interested in underage girls.\" An innocent man died because of assumptions made without verification. Chris Carroll was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum 21-year term at Chelmsford Crown Court in 2016.\n\nThis case predates the modern social-media-driven 'hunter group' phenomenon, but it illustrates the risks inherent in informal, unregulated vigilantism.\n\nMultiple UK court cases over the past decade have involved individuals who publicly associated themselves with vigilante-style \"hunter\" groups being convicted of serious offences including false imprisonment, stalking, and violent crimes.\n\nAs a criminology researcher specialising in offender behaviour patterns and institutional safeguarding failures, I've spent three years documenting cases through The Grooming Files, an independent research platform. This analysis draws on publicly available court judgments, sentencing remarks, police statements, and media reporting between 2015-2025, alongside qualitative pattern analysis of vigilante-led safeguarding groups. All case references relate to documented convictions or judicial findings.\n\nWhile public concern about child exploitation is valid and urgent, the methods used by many vigilante groups raise serious ethical, legal, and safeguarding concerns. This analysis examines a troubling pattern: some vigilante hunter operations replicate power-abuse dynamics similar to those they claim to fight.\n\n**This is not a critique of all volunteers involved in safeguarding work, nor does it excuse or minimise child exploitation. It is an analysis of specific structural failures that have led to documented harm, including to innocent people.**\n\n## Documented Court Cases\n\nSeveral individuals who have publicly presented themselves as leaders or members of vigilante predator hunter groups have been convicted in UK courts of criminal offences. These convictions are matters of public record.\n\n## Sam Miller and James Moss: False Imprisonment Convictions\n\nSam Miller, aged 29, who identified himself as leader of the Child Online Safety Team (COST), was widely reported as among the first individuals from a paedophile hunter group to be imprisoned specifically for vigilante-related activities. At Newcastle Crown Court on 23 June 2023, Miller was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment for false imprisonment. James Moss, aged 58, was convicted alongside him and received a six-month suspended sentence for the same offence.\n\nThe conviction related to an incident on 6 February 2020, when Miller and Moss detained a man they believed was a convicted rapist. Court reporting indicated the man was forced to the ground, had a torch shone in his eyes, and was publicly confronted during a 14-minute Facebook live stream. The man was subsequently held by police for 17 hours before being released without charge. Court documents indicate he had committed no crime.\n\nIn her sentencing remarks, Judge Julie Clemitson described Miller as having an \"unhealthy obsession\" with sex offenders and an \"inflated sense of his own importance.\" The judge stated the group appeared more concerned about \"Facebook likes\" than upholding the law. Court records showed Miller had previous convictions for impersonating a police officer.\n\nDetective Sergeant Simon Wardle of Northumbria Police stated: \"Sam Miller and James Moss had ulterior motives and set out to cause harm… This behaviour will not be tolerated.\"\n\n## Philip Hoban: Racially Aggravated Offence Conviction\n\nPhilip Hoban, aged 48, who has publicly presented himself as the founder of Predator Exposure UK. A group claiming over 500,000 Facebook followers, was imprisoned at Leeds Crown Court on 15 August 2024. His conviction related to racially aggravated threatening behaviour during demonstrations on The Headrow, Leeds on 3 August 2024, unconnected to his vigilante activities.\n\nHoban pleaded guilty to the charges. Court reporting indicated video footage showed him making racist gestures. Judge Guy Kearl KC, Recorder of Leeds, described his actions as \"designed to stir up hatred.\" He received eight months' imprisonment and a five-year Criminal Behaviour Order.\n\nCourt records showed Hoban had previous convictions for arson, affray, and theft, which predated his public involvement in vigilante activities.\n\n## Kieren Ashby (Stinson Hunter): Stalking Conviction\n\nKieren Ashby, aged 43, who performs under the name Stinson Hunter and appeared in the BAFTA-winning 2014 Channel 4 documentary \"The Paedophile Hunter,\" was convicted at Hamilton Sheriff Court in Scotland on 17 January 2025 of stalking a female journalist.\n\nCourt documents indicated that when personal details about Ashby were published online in January 2023, he publicly accused the journalist of \"backing paedophiles.\" According to court reporting, he posted content that resulted in the journalist receiving abusive messages from his social media followers, which numbered over 500,000. The court found this contributed to a stalking campaign that caused the journalist fear and alarm. She was forced to change her vehicle and close her social media accounts.\n\nSheriff Louise Gallacher sentenced Ashby to 12 months' supervision and an eight-month electronic curfew (7pm to 7am), along with a five-year non-harassment order. The Sheriff stated she took into account his past trauma and 13 years without prior offending since his earlier conviction.\n\nCourt records show Ashby previously served a prison sentence for arson after setting fire to a school, causing approximately £250,000 in damage. This conviction preceded his involvement in vigilante activities.\n\n## Structural Risk Factors\n\nThe court cases documented above illustrate specific failure modes that can occur when safeguarding-related activities operate outside professional frameworks. These are observable patterns rather than universal characteristics of all such groups.\n\n## 1. Absence of Regulatory Safeguarding Frameworks\n\nProfessionally regulated safeguarding work operates within frameworks that include clear thresholds for intervention, supervision structures, escalation pathways, and external accountability mechanisms. These typically include safeguarding policies, trauma-informed training requirements, formal risk assessment procedures, and regulatory oversight.\n\nThe observations made by Judge Clemitson regarding Miller's \"inflated sense of his own importance\" and the group's apparent focus on \"Facebook likes\" point to what can occur in the absence of such frameworks: operational decisions driven by factors other than evidence-based safeguarding principles, with no external mechanism to identify or correct this drift.\n\n## 2. Misidentification Risks\n\nThe 2015 case involving Darren Kelly demonstrates the potential consequences of misidentification. Police confirmed Kelly was innocent and had no interest in underage individuals. The Miller and Moss case documented a second instance: a man was publicly confronted, physically detained, held by police for 17 hours, and subsequently released without charge after being misidentified.\n\nCommon factors that can contribute to misidentification in unregulated operations include reliance on unverified digital information, incomplete understanding of how IP addresses and device attribution work, dependence on screenshots or third-party information, and absence of forensic validation processes.\n\nWhen a name or image circulates online in this context, reputational harm can be immediate and irreversible, even if the person is later found to be uninvolved.\n\n## 3. Evidence Handling and Prosecution Risks\n\nFrom a criminal justice perspective, evidence gathering by unregulated groups can create complications for formal investigations. Potential issues include questioning techniques that may be considered leading or coercive, behaviour that could be characterised as entrapment, alterations to digital evidence chains, public exposure of material before police assessment, and failure to preserve technical metadata required for court proceedings.\n\nFollowing the COST convictions, Northumbria Police stated: \"It is essential that the correct procedures are followed around the gathering of evidence, questioning of suspects and safeguarding of any potential victims… Such actions can undoubtedly reduce the prospect of successful prosecutions and can actually harm live, ongoing, evidence-led police investigations.\"\n\nA particular area of legal complexity involves the use of decoy profiles. Professional undercover operations conducted by police operate under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) with strict authorisation procedures, supervisory oversight, and clear legal guidance on the distinction between providing opportunity for someone to commit an offence they were already predisposed to commit versus inducing behaviour that would not otherwise have occurred. Unregulated operations do not operate within this framework, which can create evidential complications.\n\n## 4. Internal Power Dynamics\n\nCourt observations and documented cases reveal patterns of internal dynamics that can emerge in groups lacking formal accountability structures. Judge Clemitson's description of Miller as having an \"inflated sense of his own importance\" and leading a group apparently focused on \"Facebook likes\" illustrates how performance metrics—social media engagement, follower counts, video views—can potentially become significant motivating factors.\n\nThe Ashby stalking case documented how a platform of 500,000+ followers was used in a manner the court found constituted stalking, demonstrating how audience size can be weaponised when internal accountability structures are absent.\n\nObservable patterns in such environments can include concentration of decision-making authority, pressure on participants to conform \"for the cause,\" fear of exclusion or retaliation for questioning methods, and loyalty dynamics framed through the lens of the group's stated mission.\n\n## 5. Data Handling Without Legal Framework\n\nVigilante operations often involve handling personal data, addresses, phone numbers, employment information, private communications, without the legal basis, consent frameworks, or security protocols required under data protection law (GDPR).\n\nThis creates both legal risks and safeguarding risks, particularly when third parties are contacted, employers are approached with allegations, data is shared across platforms without encryption or access controls, or information is stored without appropriate security measures.\n\n## 6. Exposure as Primary Outcome\n\nAn observable pattern in some operations is the shift from safeguarding as the primary goal to exposure and confrontation as rewarding outcomes in themselves. The Miller case exemplified this: the judge specifically noted the group's apparent focus on \"Facebook likes\" and the choice to conduct a 14-minute live-streamed confrontation of someone later found to be innocent.\n\nResearch into behavioural patterns suggests that for some individuals, positions involving public confrontation and exposure can provide psychological rewards independent of the stated safeguarding purpose. When this occurs, the performance of protection can become more significant than protection itself.\n\n## 7. Absence of Accountability Infrastructure\n\nFormally regulated safeguarding work operates within accountability structures including ethics review boards, regulatory bodies with inspection powers, professional standards enforced through licensing, formal complaints procedures, and legal liability frameworks.\n\nUnregulated operations typically lack all of these. When harm occurs, as documented in the court cases above, there is often no independent review mechanism, no regulatory oversight to investigate, no enforceable duty of care, and no meaningful accountability pathway beyond criminal prosecution in the most serious cases.\n\nThe Miller case illustrated this: an innocent person experienced significant harm, but no internal mechanism existed within the group to have prevented, identified, or reviewed this action prior to police intervention.\n\n## Individuals With Prior Convictions in Leadership Roles\n\nProfessional safeguarding organisations conduct vetting processes that extend beyond basic Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks. DBS checks reveal convictions, cautions, and in enhanced checks, certain relevant police intelligence, but they only show what is formally recorded.\n\nThe documented cases show that some individuals who later assumed prominent or leadership roles in vigilante groups had prior criminal convictions:\n\n- Philip Hoban publicly led a group claiming 500,000 followers. Court records showed he had previous convictions for arson, affray, and theft\n\n- Kieren Ashby became the most publicly recognised face of UK vigilante hunting. Court records showed he had previously served a prison sentence for arson causing £250,000 damage\n\n- Sam Miller led a group. Court records showed he had previous convictions for impersonating a police officer\n\nThe absence of formal vetting processes beyond self-declaration means there is no structural barrier preventing individuals with relevant criminal histories from assuming positions of authority in such operations.\n\nThis creates structural vulnerabilities. Leadership of a vigilante group can provide: access to data about vulnerable individuals and families, perceived moral authority and public trust, protective framing against scrutiny, intelligence about investigative methods and evidence standards, and direct contact with potentially vulnerable people through public platforms.\n\nResearch into institutional safeguarding failures has repeatedly demonstrated that some individuals are drawn to positions of authority in child protection contexts for reasons unrelated to safeguarding. Without professional vetting, psychological assessment, or regulatory oversight, such patterns cannot be identified or prevented.\n\n## Why Structural Analysis Matters\n\nThis analysis should not be misunderstood as defending child exploitation, which is a serious crime requiring robust responses. Rather, it examines what structures and safeguards are necessary for child protection work to function without creating new vectors for harm.\n\nThe documented cases demonstrate several categories of harm that have resulted from unregulated operations:\n\n**Harm to innocent people**: Darren Kelly was killed. A man in the Miller case experienced detention, public humiliation, police custody, and lasting psychological impact, all while innocent.\n\n**Harm to prosecution processes**: Police have explicitly stated that unregulated operations can compromise viable prosecutions, potentially allowing actual offenders to avoid conviction.\n\n**Harm to safeguarding integrity**: When operations are driven by social media metrics rather than safeguarding outcomes, the work ceases to function as protection.\n\n**Harm to journalists and critics**: The Ashby stalking conviction documented the weaponisation of a large platform against a journalist.\n\nProfessionally regulated safeguarding work operates under:\n\n- Regulatory oversight from bodies such as Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission\n\n- Legal frameworks including RIPA for undercover work and GDPR for data handling\n\n- Ethical standards enforced by professional bodies\n\n- Formal complaints mechanisms with independent review\n\n- Enforceable duty of care obligations\n\n- Evidence standards designed to support successful prosecutions\n\nUnregulated operations typically have none of these structures. The court cases documented above show consequences that can follow from this absence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis analysis has documented multiple UK court cases involving individuals who publicly associated themselves with vigilante-style hunter groups being convicted of serious criminal offences including murder (of an innocent person), false imprisonment (of an innocent person), stalking, and racially aggravated offences. These are matters of public record, documented in court judgments, sentencing remarks, and police statements.\n\nThe pattern these cases reveal is structural rather than individual: without professional frameworks, oversight, and accountability, operations claiming to serve safeguarding purposes can produce significant harm while failing to serve their stated protective function.\n\nThe question is not whether child exploitation is a serious issue requiring action, it unquestionably is. The question is what structures, safeguards, and accountability mechanisms are necessary to ensure that responses to this problem actually protect children and innocent people, rather than creating new risks.\n\nThe documented cases suggest that unregulated operations lacking professional safeguarding frameworks, operating without oversight, prioritising social media engagement over evidence standards, and in some documented instances led by individuals with serious prior criminal convictions, do not meet this threshold.\n\nProfessional safeguarding exists for specific, evidence-based reasons. The alternative approach is now documented in multiple criminal convictions, substantial harm to innocent people, and police statements indicating disruption to viable prosecutions.\n\nEffective child protection requires the difficult work of building proper structures, accountability, and professional standards, not the performance of protection through public confrontation.\n\n---\n\n**AUTHOR BIO:**\nSophie Lewis is a final-year criminology student specialising in forensic psychology at the Open University and an NUJ-accredited investigative journalist.

The Miller and Moss case documented a second instance: a man was publicly confronted, physically detained, held by police for 17 hours, and subsequently released without charge after being misidentified.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Common factors that can contribute to misidentification in unregulated operations include reliance on unverified digital information, incomplete understanding of how IP addresses and device attribution work, dependence on screenshots or third-party information, and absence of forensic validation processes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When a name or image circulates online in this context, reputational harm can be immediate and irreversible, even if the person is later found to be uninvolved.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"3-evidence-handling-and-prosecution-risks\">3. Evidence Handling and Prosecution Risks\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>From a criminal justice perspective, evidence gathering by unregulated groups can create complications for formal investigations. Potential issues include questioning techniques that may be considered leading or coercive, behaviour that could be characterised as entrapment, alterations to digital evidence chains, public exposure of material before police assessment, and failure to preserve technical metadata required for court proceedings.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Following the COST convictions, Northumbria Police stated: “It is essential that the correct procedures are followed around the gathering of evidence, questioning of suspects and safeguarding of any potential victims… Such actions can undoubtedly reduce the prospect of successful prosecutions and can actually harm live, ongoing, evidence-led police investigations.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A particular area of legal complexity involves the use of decoy profiles. Professional undercover operations conducted by police operate under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) with strict authorisation procedures, supervisory oversight, and clear legal guidance on the distinction between providing opportunity for someone to commit an offence they were already predisposed to commit versus inducing behaviour that would not otherwise have occurred. Unregulated operations do not operate within this framework, which can create evidential complications.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"4-internal-power-dynamics\">4. Internal Power Dynamics\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Court observations and documented cases reveal patterns of internal dynamics that can emerge in groups lacking formal accountability structures. Judge Clemitson’s description of Miller as having an “inflated sense of his own importance” and leading a group apparently focused on “Facebook likes” illustrates how performance metrics—social media engagement, follower counts, video views—can potentially become significant motivating factors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Ashby stalking case documented how a platform of 500,000+ followers was used in a manner the court found constituted stalking, demonstrating how audience size can be weaponised when internal accountability structures are absent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Observable patterns in such environments can include concentration of decision-making authority, pressure on participants to conform “for the cause,” fear of exclusion or retaliation for questioning methods, and loyalty dynamics framed through the lens of the group’s stated mission.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"5-data-handling-without-legal-framework\">5. Data Handling Without Legal Framework\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Vigilante operations often involve handling personal data, addresses, phone numbers, employment information, private communications, without the legal basis, consent frameworks, or security protocols required under data protection law (GDPR).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This creates both legal risks and safeguarding risks, particularly when third parties are contacted, employers are approached with allegations, data is shared across platforms without encryption or access controls, or information is stored without appropriate security measures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"6-exposure-as-primary-outcome\">6. Exposure as Primary Outcome\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>An observable pattern in some operations is the shift from safeguarding as the primary goal to exposure and confrontation as rewarding outcomes in themselves. The Miller case exemplified this: the judge specifically noted the group’s apparent focus on “Facebook likes” and the choice to conduct a 14-minute live-streamed confrontation of someone later found to be innocent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Research into behavioural patterns suggests that for some individuals, positions involving public confrontation and exposure can provide psychological rewards independent of the stated safeguarding purpose. When this occurs, the performance of protection can become more significant than protection itself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"7-absence-of-accountability-infrastructure\">7. Absence of Accountability Infrastructure\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Formally regulated safeguarding work operates within accountability structures including ethics review boards, regulatory bodies with inspection powers, professional standards enforced through licensing, formal complaints procedures, and legal liability frameworks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Unregulated operations typically lack all of these. When harm occurs, as documented in the court cases above, there is often no independent review mechanism, no regulatory oversight to investigate, no enforceable duty of care, and no meaningful accountability pathway beyond criminal prosecution in the most serious cases.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Miller case illustrated this: an innocent person experienced significant harm, but no internal mechanism existed within the group to have prevented, identified, or reviewed this action prior to police intervention.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"individuals-with-prior-convictions-in-leadership-roles\">Individuals With Prior Convictions in Leadership Roles\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Professional safeguarding organisations conduct vetting processes that extend beyond basic Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks. DBS checks reveal convictions, cautions, and in enhanced checks, certain relevant police intelligence, but they only show what is formally recorded.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The documented cases show that some individuals who later assumed prominent or leadership roles in vigilante groups had prior criminal convictions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Philip Hoban publicly led a group claiming 500,000 followers.

Court records showed he had previously served a prison sentence for arson causing £250,000 damage\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Sam Miller led a group. Court records showed he had previous convictions for impersonating a police officer\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>The absence of formal vetting processes beyond self-declaration means there is no structural barrier preventing individuals with relevant criminal histories from assuming positions of authority in such operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This creates structural vulnerabilities. Leadership of a vigilante group can provide: access to data about vulnerable individuals and families, perceived moral authority and public trust, protective framing against scrutiny, intelligence about investigative methods and evidence standards, and direct contact with potentially vulnerable people through public platforms.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Research into institutional safeguarding failures has repeatedly demonstrated that some individuals are drawn to positions of authority in child protection contexts for reasons unrelated to safeguarding. Without professional vetting, psychological assessment, or regulatory oversight, such patterns cannot be identified or prevented.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"why-structural-analysis-matters\">Why Structural Analysis Matters\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This analysis should not be misunderstood as defending child exploitation, which is a serious crime requiring robust responses. Rather, it examines what structures and safeguards are necessary for child protection work to function without creating new vectors for harm.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The documented cases demonstrate several categories of harm that have resulted from unregulated operations:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Harm to innocent people\u003C/strong>: Darren Kelly was killed.

These are matters of public record, documented in court judgments, sentencing remarks, and police statements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The pattern these cases reveal is structural rather than individual: without professional frameworks, oversight, and accountability, operations claiming to serve safeguarding purposes can produce significant harm while failing to serve their stated protective function.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The question is not whether child exploitation is a serious issue requiring action, it unquestionably is. The question is what structures, safeguards, and accountability mechanisms are necessary to ensure that responses to this problem actually protect children and innocent people, rather than creating new risks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The documented cases suggest that unregulated operations lacking professional safeguarding frameworks, operating without oversight, prioritising social media engagement over evidence standards, and in some documented instances led by individuals with serious prior criminal convictions, do not meet this threshold.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Professional safeguarding exists for specific, evidence-based reasons. The alternative approach is now documented in multiple criminal convictions, substantial harm to innocent people, and police statements indicating disruption to viable prosecutions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Effective child protection requires the difficult work of building proper structures, accountability, and professional standards, not the performance of protection through public confrontation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>AUTHOR BIO:\u003C/strong>\nSophie Lewis is a final-year criminology student specialising in forensic psychology at the Open University and an NUJ-accredited investigative journalist.

We highlight grooming in schools, but not online, or behind closed doors. We offer therapy after harm, but avoid conversations that might *prevent* it in the first place.\n\nThis article is a survivor-informed reckoning. No sugar-coating. No safe metaphors. Just truth.\n\n---\n\n## Not Just Monsters\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000c624620a911a29e071b11cd95448095534746918925.png?w=683)\n\nAbusers are not always creepy strangers. In fact, they rarely are.\n\nThey're dads. Stepfathers. Mothers. Uncles. Siblings. Family friends. Coaches. Teachers. Priests.\n\nThey are people the child knows and often loves.\n\nThe public image of abusers as obvious, violent \"monsters\" gives everyone else an excuse to look away from the ones hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe truth? Most child sexual abuse is committed by someone in the child's circle of trust.\n\nUntil we dismantle the monster myth, we will keep missing the ones who are *already in the room*.\n\n---\n\n## Women Abuse Too\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_00000000320c6246a61203bc93e1ad35281295716662308264218755.jpg?w=1024)\n\nFemale abusers are rarely discussed, let alone believed.\n\nSociety still struggles to see women as capable of sexual harm, especially when the victims are male, or when the offender is a mother, teacher, or carer.\n\nVictims of female offenders are often told to feel lucky, confused, or ashamed. Many stay silent their entire lives.\n\nThe truth: women can and do sexually abuse children. And the longer we avoid this, the longer survivors go unseen.\n\n---\n\n## Child-on-Child and Sibling Abuse\n\nOne of the most hidden forms of abuse is when it happens between children.\n\nThis is not harmless curiosity. It is often a sign that one or more of the children involved has been exposed to sexual harm themselves.\n\nSibling abuse is rarely reported and often dismissed by families as a \"phase\" or a \"one-off mistake.\"\n\nThe impact, however, can be lifelong.\n\nPrevention means recognising these early warning signs, intervening supportively, and understanding that children can both be harmed and cause harm, especially when they’re left unsupported in unsafe environments.\n\n---\n\n## Survivors Raising Children\n\nMany adults who are now parents or carers grew up as victims themselves, but were never given language, safety, or support to heal.\n\nThis silence can lead to:\n\n- Overprotection\n\n- Underreaction\n\n- Confusion around red flags\n\n- Generational cycles of shame\n\nSurvivors raising children deserve resources, space, and community. Not silence, judgement, or isolation.\n\nSupporting them is part of prevention.\n\n---\n\n## \"Good\" Homes Aren't Always Safe\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000007b94523095c26117bde3d060_conversation_id3d67ef9ede-43f4-8002-9120-115acedf781c26message_id3d9ad49a11-a0b3-45de-a16a-71cdb257fcf96427067552757920372.jpg?w=1024)\n\nAbuse doesn't only happen in chaotic or under-resourced families. It happens in \"good homes\" too:\n\n- Clean houses\n\n- Private schools\n\n- Religious families\n\n- Professional parents\n\nThese families are often shielded from suspicion because of their appearance or status.\n\nThe truth: abuse thrives wherever there is power, secrecy, and denial.\n\nWe need to stop confusing order with safety. Respectability doesn't protect children, transparency and truth do.\n\n---\n\n## The Proof Problem\n\n![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/file_000000009ef8620a85cc2a21aec20c27_conversation_id3d67fae4e9-3b74-8002-878b-470c0fe4913f26message_id3ded4d96dc-2cc0-4126-b6b8-5c2b551d61fe281293391115862677864489.jpg?w=1024)\n\nMost child sexual abuse cases never make it to court. Of those that do, few end in conviction.\n\nWhy? Because we still expect children to provide adult-level evidence:\n\n- Consistent timelines\n\n- Forensic detail\n\n- Logical recounting of trauma\n\nBut trauma doesn't speak in perfect sentences. Especially not from a child.\n\nWe must stop demanding \"proof\" before we protect. Listening and believing is the first step.\n\n---\n\n## What Real Prevention Looks Like\n\nReal prevention doesn't begin after an arrest. It begins in homes, schools, and conversations that are brave enough to name what others avoid.\n\nPrevention means:\n\n- Age-appropriate education on body safety and consent\n\n- Teaching children about grooming and secrets\n\n- Spotting and responding to red flags in children’s behaviour\n\n- Believing disclosures without demanding perfect evidence\n\n- Creating a culture where survivors can speak and be heard\n\nIt’s not enough to be shocked when abuse is exposed. We need to be *louder* than the silence that allows it.\n\n---\n\n## If You Want to Protect Children\n\nProtecting children doesn’t start with background checks or catchy slogans. It starts with us.\n\nWith our courage to name abuse. With our willingness to believe survivors. With our ability to sit in discomfort and *still choose to act*.\n\n> \n> If you want to protect children, start by listening to the truths we’ve all been taught to avoid.\n> \n> \n> \n\nBecause what we’re not talking about? That’s where the danger still lives.\n\n---\n\n**This piece is the start of a full series**. \n\nEach section will be explored in more depth over the coming articles.

He asked her to imagine him as “pocket-sized, like six inches,” told her she could “do anything she wanted” with him, and added that “only you and me would know.”\n\nThe student said it felt sexual.\n\nBut the **Education Workforce Council Wales panel** decided it wasn’t, because he said it wasn’t.\n\nWelcome to modern safeguarding, where harm must be explicit, provable, and undeniable before it counts.\n\n---\n\n## Intent Is Not the Point\n\nSafeguarding was never supposed to revolve around whether an adult admits sexual intent.\n\nIf that’s the bar, safeguarding is already dead.\n\nThe entire purpose of professional boundaries is to prevent situations where intent becomes irrelevant, because the power imbalance already exists. A teacher doesn’t need to be sexually aroused to cause harm. They don’t need to want a relationship.

It was part of a wider pattern:\n\n- Acting as a “father figure” to a vulnerable student\n\n- Physical contact with students, hair touching, hugging\n\n- Personal comments about students’ relationships\n\n- Private messaging outside approved channels\n\n- Continuing after being warned\n\n- Deleting messages once investigated\n\nThat’s not awkwardness.\nThat’s boundary erosion.\n\n**Safeguarding frameworks are designed to identify patterns, not excuse them.**\nThis case had multiple red flags, but they were treated as quirks instead of risk indicators.\n\n---\n\n## “She Thought It Was Sexual” Should Have Been Enough\n\nHere’s the part that should end the debate entirely:\n\n**The student experienced it as sexual.**\n\nThat should have been the point where the conversation stopped.\n\nSafeguarding is about impact, not intent. About how behaviour is experienced by the person with less power. About how it lands in a vulnerable context.\n\nInstead, her experience was acknowledged, then quietly overridden.\n\nBecause he didn’t mean it.\nBecause it wasn’t explicit.\nBecause it wasn’t provable enough.\n\nThat sends a brutal message to students everywhere:\n**Your discomfort is negotiable.**\n\n---\n\n## Deleting Messages Is Not “Panic” — It’s Awareness\n\nAnother moment brushed aside far too easily: he deleted messages once the investigation began.\n\nIn safeguarding contexts, deletion isn’t neutral. It indicates awareness that boundaries were crossed, that something wouldn’t look right under scrutiny.\n\nWhether those messages were “innocent” or not is beside the point.

Sophie Lewis | The Grooming Files**\n\n---\n\nLong before grooming gang cases reached courtrooms, another decision had already been made.\n\nNot by offenders, but by the institutions meant to protect children.\n\nThe decision was this..\n**that the girls being abused were the risk.**\n\nOnce that framing took hold, everything else followed.\n\n---\n\n## How Language Was Used to Disarm Safeguarding\n\nAcross grooming gang cases, the same words appear again and again in records, assessments, and professional notes.\n\nGirls were described as:\n\n- \"promiscuous\"\n\n- \"streetwise\"\n\n- \"sexually active\"\n\n- \"hard to engage\"\n\n- \"making choices\"\n\n- \"placing themselves at risk\"\n\nThese weren't neutral descriptions.\n\nThey were protective language, not for the child, but for the system.\n\nBecause once a child is framed as choosing risk, the obligation to intervene weakens.\n\n---\n\n## From Victim to Liability\n\nThe shift was subtle but devastating.\n\nInstead of asking:\n\n> \n> Why are adult men targeting this child?\n> \n> \n> \n\nThe question became:\n\n> \n> Why does this child keep putting herself in danger?\n> \n> \n> \n\nThat reframing did several things at once:\n\n- It stripped the child of credibility\n\n- It lowered the urgency of intervention\n\n- It shifted responsibility away from perpetrators\n\n- It justified professional inaction\n\nAbuse didn't disappear.\n\nIt was administratively neutralised.\n\n---\n\n## Oxford: When \"Difficult\" Meant \"Not Our Problem\"\n\nThe 2015 Serious Case Review into Oxfordshire explicitly documented this reframing in action.\n\nThe review found that professionals **\"saw the girls as the source not the victims of their extreme behaviour\"**.\n\nGirls who were being systematically abused were described in records as:\n\n- \"very difficult\"\n\n- \"making bad choices\"\n\n- displaying \"extreme behaviour\"\n\nThe review stated clearly:\n\n**\"That the girls had lost the ability to consent or make their own decisions due to grooming was not realised.\"**\n\nInstead, frequent missing episodes were **\"put in the context of them being extremely difficult children\"** rather than evidence of ongoing exploitation.\n\nThe abuse continued for years while professionals recorded concerns about the girls' behaviour, not the men abusing them.\n\n---\n\n## \"Consenting\" — The Word That Should Never Have Been Used\n\nPerhaps the most corrosive reframing of all was the suggestion of consent.\n\nGirls as young as 13, 14, 15 were described implicitly or explicitly as \"consenting\", \"sexually aware\", or \"choosing relationships\".\n\nThis language ignored a basic truth:\n\n**Children cannot consent to their own exploitation.**\n\nBut by leaning on sexualised stereotypes, particularly of working-class girls in care  institutions found a way to downgrade abuse into behaviour management.\n\nOnce that happens, safeguarding stops being about protection and starts being about control.\n\n---\n\n## Why Certain Girls Were Easier to Ignore\n\nNot all victims were treated the same.\n\nThose most likely to be dismissed shared common characteristics:\n\n- in care or on the edge of care\n\n- from deprived backgrounds\n\n- already labelled \"troubled\"\n\n- with prior involvement from police or youth services\n\nTheir histories were used against them.\n\nPast trauma became evidence of unreliability.\nDistress became proof of instability.\nSurvival behaviour became \"choice\".\n\nThe system didn't just fail these girls.\n\nIt judged them.\n\n---\n\n## Professionals Didn't Need to Be Cruel — Just Comfortable\n\nThis wasn't about individual malice.\n\nMost of the professionals involved weren't predators or villains.\n\nThey were people operating inside a culture that rewarded risk avoidance, not child protection.\n\nA culture where:\n\n- escalating concerns meant paperwork and scrutiny\n\n- challenging colleagues meant conflict\n\n- naming abuse meant institutional consequences\n\nSo the easier path was taken.\n\nLanguage softened.\nRisk was reframed.\nResponsibility was diffused.\n\nAnd children paid the price.\n\n---\n\n## This Pattern Isn't Unique to Grooming Gangs\n\nWhat makes this especially dangerous is that it isn't confined to grooming gang cases.\n\nThe same reframing appears in:\n\n- school abuse cases\n\n- care home scandals\n\n- online exploitation\n\n- peer-on-peer abuse responses\n\nDifferent context.\nSame mechanism.\n\nWhen systems struggle to act, they often solve the discomfort by redefining the victim.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Still Hasn't Been Properly Confronted\n\nEven now, discussions about grooming gangs often focus on:\n\n- policing failures\n\n- community tensions\n\n- prosecution rates\n\nWhat's talked about far less is how institutional language enabled abuse to continue.\n\nBecause confronting that means admitting something uncomfortable:\n\nThat harm wasn't just overlooked.\nIt was managed.\n\n---\n\n## The Question We Still Avoid\n\nThe most dangerous question isn't \"why didn't we know?\"\n\nIt's this:\n\n**Why was it easier to believe these girls were the problem than to act against the adults abusing them?**\n\nUntil institutions answer that honestly, safeguarding reforms will keep failing.\n\nAnd children will keep learning the same lesson:\n\nThat telling the truth doesn't always mean being protected.\n\n---\n\n**Sophie Lewis | NUJ-Accredited Investigative Journalist**\n**The Grooming Files**\n\n*Next in this series: \"What Happened to the

They were right into our faces shouting and yelling. ‘Stand to attention you fucking scum.’”\n> \n> \n> \n\nPolice officers transporting boys to Medomsley witnessed these assaults and did nothing.\n\n#### PHYSICAL EDUCATION: WEAPONISED VIOLENCE\n\nThe gym became a torture chamber under physical training instructor [Perpetrator B], against whom 618 victims made allegations:\n• Boys were beaten with hockey sticks\n• Forced to play “murder ball” – encouraged to violently attack each other\n• Made to climb ropes while instructors shook them or threw objects\n• Asthmatic children denied inhalers and punished for struggling to breathe\n\nOne victim described being hit in the face with football boots with exposed studs by the PE instructor, fracturing his skull. Another had his fingers deliberately stamped on and broken.\n\nSome boys broke their own bones to escape the gym.\n\n═════════════════════\n\n### THE PREDATOR: NEVILLE HUSBAND\n\nAt the centre of the sexual abuse was Neville Husband, the catering officer who ran the kitchen from 1969 to 1985.\n\n**HIS METHODS:**\n• Selected vulnerable boys – the small, timid, or those who looked “feminine”\n• Isolated them in the kitchen, away from other staff\n• Used pornography to groom victims\n• Threatened boys they could “disappear” and nobody would care\n• Held them at knifepoint during rapes\n• Strangled victims during assaults for sexual gratification\n• Photographed and filmed abuse\n• Took boys off-site to be abused by groups of men\n• Continued abusing boys after their release, visiting their homes\n\nThe investigation found Husband engaged in “group-based child sexual exploitation” – taking boys to houses where they were raped by multiple perpetrators, including a serving police officer and potentially a magistrate.\n\n═════════════════════\n\n### EVERYBODY KNEW\n\nThis is not a story of abuse that went undetected. This is a story of institutional complicity.\n\n#### PRISON STAFF KNEW\n\nThe report presents damning evidence that staff at Medomsley were widely aware of the abuse:\n\n**PORNOGRAPHY DELIVERIES:**\nHomosexual pornography was regularly delivered to Medomsley addressed to Husband. One gate officer burned “about 30” packages rather than report them. Officers told investigators they didn’t report it because Husband was “well liked by management.”\n\n**THE KITCHEN SEARCH THAT NEVER HAPPENED:**\nWhen one probationary officer searched the kitchen in 1978, he found a dildo and pornography. Husband physically assaulted him, slamming him against a wall and punching him repeatedly. The principal officer ordered:\n\n> \n> “You don’t go near the kitchen again, it’s come from ‘up’ that you are not under any circumstances to search the kitchen ever again.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nAfter Husband left in 1985, staff found:\n• A white dildo\n• Vaseline\n• Pornographic magazines\n• Women’s underwear, thongs, suspender belts\n—all in a locked cabinet in his office.\n\nThey told no one. They destroyed the evidence.\n\n**WARNING THE BOYS:**\nMultiple prison officers warned new arrivals not to work in the kitchens. One officer handed a boy a jar of Vaseline and said:\n\n> \n> “Give that to Neville... You’ll need that.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nAnother told a boy:\n\n> \n> “You’re going to be Mr Husband’s new wife.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nThen they laughed.\n\nTrainees who disclosed abuse to staff were:\n• Told to “keep your mouth shut”\n• Threatened with being sent back to Medomsley\n• Further assaulted for reporting\n• Made to lose remission (extended sentences)\n\n#### THE WARDENS FAILED\n\nMultiple wardens witnessed physical abuse and took no action:\n\n> \n> “The governor witnessed this attack... He wore a suit as opposed to a uniform.”\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> “I was standing in front of the governor... the officer who was standing behind me on my right-hand side hit me full force to my head with his hand.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nOne former warden admitted he should have been “more intrusive” in inspecting areas like the kitchen flat where Husband committed abuse. Another acknowledged that visits were effectively announced because he had to call ahead to be let in through the gates.\n\nThe report concludes wardens were either complicit or “lacked dedication and professional curiosity to such an extent as to not be professionally competent.”\n\n#### POLICE DISMISSED VICTIMS\n\nThe report reveals systematic failures by police:\n\n**AT POLICE STATIONS:**\nWhen victims reported abuse after release:\n• One was told: “Fuck off, get the bus, think yourself lucky” (Consett police station, 1978)\n• Another warned: “We’ve heard it all before, just go home or you’ll find yourself back inside there” (1979)\n• A police officer laughed and said the victim “had not gone there for a holiday” when his father tried to report abuse\n\nSome victims made written statements to police. These statements have vanished.\n\n**EVEN WHEN FAMILIES INTERVENED:**\nOne grandfather took his grandson to Durham police station while the boy was still at Medomsley after seeing injuries during a visit. Police called the detention centre and asked if officers were beating boys. They were told no. The abuse increased after this call.\n\n**A SERVING OFFICER WAS A PERPETRATOR:**\nThe investigation identified Subject A, a serving local police officer, who sexually abused at least one victim after being introduced to him by Neville Husband during fishing trips.\n\n#### THE HOME OFFICE KNEW SINCE 1965\n\nGovernment knowledge of abuse at Medomsley dates back to its earliest years:\n\n**1965:** A father wrote to the Home Office demanding an enquiry after his son escaped. The *Newcastle Evening Chronicle* published allegations from multiple boys about being hit with sticks and fists “for no reason.”\n\n**1967:** Two former trainees provided detailed statements to the *Northern Echo* about physical abuse and medical neglect. These were sent to Home Secretary Roy Jenkins. Nine days later, Home Office minister Lord Stonham replied that “careful enquiries had been made” and there was “nothing to substantiate” the claims.\n\nNo records of these investigations exist.\n\nAlso in 1967: The director of borstal administration wrote to **all** detention centre wardens acknowledging that officers were giving out their own punishments in the form of “bunny jumps” and assaults like “a box on the ear” and that this had to stop.\n\nIt didn’t stop. For another 20 years.\n\n#### PROBATION OFFICERS DIDN’T BELIEVE VICTIMS\n\nAt least 26 victims disclosed abuse to probation officers. Only two disclosures were escalated to senior staff.\n\n**CASE STUDY – WITNESS F:**\nAfter being repeatedly raped by Husband and other men at Medomsley, Witness F told his probation officer everything. The probation officer advised him he would be sent back inside if he continued to make “false allegations.”\n\nYears later, at a probation hostel, he disclosed again to assistant warden Witness G, who was shocked and immediately escalated it. The victim wrote a detailed statement. The warden of the hostel said he would “deal with it.”\n\nNothing happened.\n\nThat warden later became the senior probation officer at Medomsley.\n\nThe victim disappeared, changed his name, and went into hiding for decades, believing Husband would track him down.\n\n#### MEDICAL STAFF HAD CONCERNS\n\nAn experienced nurse at Shotley Bridge Hospital became alarmed when three trainees from Medomsley were admitted with nephritis (kidney inflammation) in a short time – a rare condition in young men.\n\nA student nurse told her it wasn’t nephritis – it was from “rabbit punches to the kidneys.” The student nurse said “it was common knowledge, and everyone knew that.”\n\nNo action was taken.\n\nTrainees attended hospital with:\n• Fractured skulls\n• Broken bones\n• Cracked vertebrae\n• Severe burns\n\nThey were escorted by prison staff and threatened beforehand to lie about how injuries occurred. Medical staff questioned some accounts but had no power to investigate further.\n\n═════════════════════\n\n### TWO DEATHS: THE ULTIMATE FAILURE\n\nIn 1981–82, two young men died at Medomsley within four months of each other:\n\n**IAN ANGUS SHACKLETON** (18, diabetic) died in September 1981 after being given the wrong type and dose of insulin. Prison staff called the doctor multiple times during the night as the boy deteriorated. The doctor refused to attend and instructed them to give him milk and sugar over the phone. By morning it was too late.\n\n**DAVID VICTOR CALDWELL** (18, asthmatic) died in January 1982 after being forced to participate in outdoor exercise in the snow despite his condition. His family saw bruising during a visit and he told them “the screws” had caused it. After his death, his family’s allegations of abuse were investigated by the warden – who was investigating himself and his own staff.\n\nNeither death prompted any review of medical procedures or policies at Medomsley or across the detention centre estate.\n\n═════════════════════\n\n### THE SYSTEM THAT ENABLED ABUSE\n\nThe report identifies catastrophic systemic failures:\n\n**THE COMPLAINTS SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO FAIL**\nTo complain, boys had to:\n• Make complaints *in writing* to the officers abusing them\n• First receive a warning that false complaints would extend their sentence\n• Risk losing “remission” (early release) if the complaint wasn’t upheld\n\nLetters home were censored. Visits were cancelled if boys had visible injuries. Families couldn’t complain on their behalf.\n\nThe warden’s journal at Medomsley shows virtually no complaints were ever recorded.\n\n**“SHORT, SHARP, SHOCK” HAD NO DEFINITION**\nStaff had *no* training on how to run a detention centre. The government used words like “tough”, “robust”, and “short, sharp, shock” but never defined what this meant in practice.\n\nOfficers filled the vacuum with their own military backgrounds, implementing brutal discipline they themselves had experienced.\n\n**THE BOARD OF VISITORS WAS NOT INDEPENDENT**\nThe “independent” oversight body consisted of local magistrates – the very same people who sentenced boys to Medomsley. They:\n• Socialised with the warden and staff\n• Were escorted by prison officers during visits\n• Ate cake in the warden’s office rather than inspecting\n• When they did investigate complaints at other detention centres, they sided with staff and accused victims of being malicious\n\n**TRAINEES WERE SEEN AS INHERENTLY BAD**\nPost-war attitudes meant young offenders were viewed as worthless, deserving of harsh treatment. This extended to police, probation, medical staff and society at large.\n\nOne probation officer told a victim reporting rape:\n\n> \n> “Well, what did you expect?”\n> \n> \n> \n\n**HOMOSEXUALITY WAS CRIMINALISED AND STIGMATISED**\nThroughout Medomsley’s operation, any sexual contact between males was illegal until age 21. This meant:\n• Boys feared being seen as willing participants in illegal acts\n• Staff dismissed abuse as “consensual” homosexuality\n• Victims were shamed and called “Husband’s plaything” or “gay fairies”\n• Society had no framework to recognise male-on-male rape as serious crime\n\n═════════════════════\n\n### MISSED OPPORTUNITIES: THE COVER-UP CONTINUES\n\nEven **after** Medomsley closed, authorities continued to fail victims:\n\n**1989:** Leslie Johnston (the storeman and Husband’s accomplice) was convicted of sexually assaulting a boy at another institution. During his police interview, he admitted to sexual offences at Medomsley going back four to five years.\n\nCleveland Police conducted no wider investigation. Durham Police were never contacted.\n\n**1998:** Durham Police received information that Husband had committed “buggery on many young offenders.” They interviewed Husband once at his home. He denied everything. They closed the case, citing “lack of evidence.”\n\nThey never searched his house. They never checked with the Prison Service. They never looked for other victims.\n\n**2001–2003:** Operation Halter finally convicted Husband of 11 offences against six victims. The trial judge indicated further prosecutions would be seen as “abuse of process.”\n\nThis prevented hundreds of other victims from getting justice.\n\nHusband died in 2010, never fully held accountable.\n\n═════════════════════\n\n### THE OMBUDSMAN’S VERDICT\n\nIn his foreword, Adrian Usher writes with barely restrained fury:\n\n> \n> “The abuse at Medomsley continued, unchallenged, for the entire 26 years of its operation. The knowledge of abuse by the Prison Service, the police, the Home Office and other organisations of authority was ignored and dismissed.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n> \n> “Sending these young men to Medomsley was supposed to instil them with more ordered, law-abiding lives. The authorities failed in their duty to keep detainees safe.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n**On the wardens:**\n\n> \n> “Leaders at every level at Medomsley, including the warden, failed in their duty to protect the best interests of those under their charge. Either staff in leadership roles were aware of the abuse, in which case they were complicit, or they lacked dedication and professional curiosity to such an extent as to not be professionally competent.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n**On Husband’s ability to offend for so long:**\n\n> \n> “In order for the worst excesses of sexual abuse to continue for so long without detection required the silence of many. To achieve that silence, perpetrators required a degree of power.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n═════════════════════\n\n### THREE QUESTIONS THAT DEMAND ANSWERS TODAY\n\nThe Ombudsman makes **no** formal recommendations but asks ministers to consider three critical issues:\n\n- **WHY ARE CHILDREN IN CUSTODY STILL NOT PROACTIVELY ASKED ABOUT ABUSE?**\n\n> \n> “It is still not a requirement for every child in detention to be proactively, and regularly, asked by an independent party about their custody experience seen through a safeguarding lens.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nThe resource required would be “extremely small” given the low number of children in custody.\n\n- **WHY IS THE COMPLAINTS SYSTEM STILL THE SAME?**\n\n> \n> “The system for children to make a complaint in today’s criminal justice system remains broadly the same as the system in place when Medomsley operated.”\n> \n> \n> \n\nChildren must still write to the governor. Family members still cannot complain on their behalf.\n\n- **WHERE IS THE PUBLIC APOLOGY?**\n\n> \n> “Despite criminal convictions, civil cases and compensation paid to the victims of Medomsley, none of them have ever received a public apology.”\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> “I leave it to all of the bodies referenced in this investigation to examine their organisational consciences and determine if there is any action taken today that would diminish, even fractionally, the trauma that is still being felt by victims.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n═════════════════════\n\n### A MESSAGE TO SURVIVORS\n\nThe Ombudsman’s final words are addressed directly to victims:\n\n> \n> “I would like to thank all who came forward to speak to us, some for the very first time. You have exhibited extraordinary courage and, for some, at significant personal cost to your mental health.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n> \n> “When victims are asked what they most want, their reply is often justice. This report cannot deliver that. It cannot take away the decades of frustration, fear and mental anguish that some have lived with.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n> \n> “However, it is my fervent hope that, for many victims, what this report represents is a victory for your tenacity, determination and courage. You may have had to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles over the last 40 years and more but, in the end, you were heard, and you were believed.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n═════════════════════\n\n### THE WIDER PATTERN\n\nThe report places Medomsley in the context of widespread abuse across the detention centre estate:\n\nOther institutions under investigation or with proven abuse:\n• **Kirklevington** – Over 800 victims, ongoing police investigation\n• **Eastwood Park** – 239 compensation claims, one conviction\n• **Whatton** – 42 compensation claims\n• **Buckley Hall** – Allegations of brutality in 1960s, investigated by Board of Visitors who found them “unfounded”\n• **New Hall** – 1971 inquiry dismissed victims as “malicious”, praised accused officers\n• **Ashford Remand Centre** – 1971 inquiry found “no substance” to allegations\n\nThe patterns are identical: reception violence, gym abuse, sexual exploitation, complaints dismissed, victims not believed.\n\n═════════════════════\n\n### CALLS FOR ACTION\n\nThe report will likely trigger:\n\n**POLITICAL RESPONSE:**\n• Urgent questions in Parliament\n• Calls for criminal investigation into the cover-up\n• Review of historic compensation claims\n• Pressure for public inquiries into other detention centres\n\n**INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE:**\n• HM Prison and Probation Service must address the three questions\n• Police forces must review how they handled reports\n• Home Office must explain decades of inaction\n• Public apologies from all bodies involved\n\n**LEGAL ACTION:**\n• Potential for further civil claims\n• Calls to reopen criminal investigations where possible\n• Scrutiny of the 2005 judge’s decision that further prosecutions were “abuse of process”\n\n═════════════════════\n\n### CONTEXT: WHY THIS MATTERS NOW\n\nThis is not ancient history. This report has urgent contemporary relevance:\n\n- Children are still in custody and the safeguards that failed at Medomsley remain largely unchanged\n\n- Institutional abuse continues to be uncovered across British society – from sports to churches to care homes\n\n- Victims are still living with trauma 40+ years later, many having never received acknowledgement or justice\n\n- The pattern of disbelief persists – vulnerable people reporting abuse to authorities and being dismissed\n\n- Power imbalances remain wherever institutions hold power over vulnerable people\n\n═════════════════════\n\n### WHAT HAPPENS NEXT\n\nThe PPO investigation took 18 months and involved:\n• Reviewing nearly 8,000 documents\n• Interviewing 74 witnesses\n• Analysing material from three major police investigations\n• Conducting a call for evidence from 51 authorities\n• Examining records from Durham Constabulary, the National Archives, Ministry of Justice, Home Office, and multiple other bodies\n\n---\n\n**KEY STATISTICS:**\n• Years of operation: 1961–1987 (26 years)\n• Victims who came forward: 2,077\n• Compensation claims: 2,852\n• Allegations against Husband: 388 (primary abuser in 338 cases)\n• Staff convicted: 8 (to date)\n• Documents reviewed: Nearly 8,000\n• Witnesses interviewed: 74\n• Police investigations: 3 (Operation Halter 1, Halter 2, Seabrook)\n\n**TIMELINE OF KEY EVENTS:**\n• 1961 – Medomsley opens\n• 1965 – First complaints to Home Office\n• 1967 – Home Office director acknowledges officers using unauthorised punishments\n• 1969 – Neville Husband arrives as catering officer\n• 1981–82 – Two deaths within four months\n• 1985 – Husband leaves; staff find pornography and sex toys, report nothing\n• 1987 – Medomsley closes\n• 1989 – Johnston convicted, admits Medomsley offending, no wider investigation\n• 2001 – Operation Halter 1 begins\n• 2003 – Husband convicted of 11 offences\n• 2005 – Husband convicted of 4 more offences; judge says further trials “abuse of process”\n• 2010 – Husband dies\n• 2013 – Operation Seabrook begins\n• 2018–2019 – Further staff convicted\n• 2023 – This investigation commissioned\n• 2025 – Report published\n\n**ABOUT THE PPO:**\nThe Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is independent of the Prison Service and investigates complaints, deaths in custody, and special investigations commissioned by the Secretary of State for Justice.\n\n**ABOUT ADRIAN USHER:**\nAdrian Usher was appointed Prisons and Probation Ombudsman in April 2023.
