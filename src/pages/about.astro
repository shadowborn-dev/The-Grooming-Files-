      <p><strong>The Grooming Files</strong> is an independent investigative platform examining grooming, sexual harm, online exploitation, and systemic safeguarding failure — through survivor-led journalism, forensic insight, and real-world case analysis.</p>

      <p><em>This work does not sensationalise abuse.<br />It documents it.</em></p>

      <p>The Grooming Files exists to expose patterns — not just individual offenders, but the institutional blind spots, cultural conditions, and repeated failures that allow harm to continue unchecked.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p><strong>Survivor. Researcher. Journalist.</strong></p>

      <p>My name is <strong>Sophie Lewis</strong>.</p>

      <p>I am a survivor, a journalist, and a social science researcher specialising in criminology and forensic psychology. I hold a BA (Hons) in Social Sciences and am trained in analysing offender behaviour, grooming dynamics, and systemic harm.</p>

      <p>I created The Grooming Files because too much reporting around grooming is either sanitised, sensationalised, or structurally blind.</p>

      <p>What's missing is the inside view — the survivor perspective combined with analytical rigour.</p>

      <p><strong>That is where my work sits.</strong></p>

      <h3>My approach is grounded in:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Survivor testimony</li>
        <li>Direct behavioural analysis</li>
        <li>Message-based evidence and digital forensics</li>
        <li>Psychological pattern recognition</li>
        <li>Institutional and safeguarding critique</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My work focuses on how grooming actually works — how offenders escalate, how systems fail to intervene, and how survivors are repeatedly ignored or retraumatised by the very structures meant to protect them.</p>

      <h2>Survivor-Led, Not Sensational</h2>

      <p><em>I do not run sting operations.<br />I do not pose as children.<br />I do not engage in vigilante activity.</em></p>

      <h3>This work centres on:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Adult survivor experiences</li>
        <li>Offender self-disclosure and behavioural patterns</li>
        <li>Exposure-seeking dynamics</li>
        <li>Online grooming culture</li>
        <li>Safeguarding failures across platforms, institutions, and communities</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In several cases, offenders have voluntarily come forward, consented to interviews, and provided extensive message logs. These cases are handled within strict ethical boundaries and documented in the public interest.</p>

      <p><strong>The aim is understanding, prevention, and accountability — not spectacle.</strong></p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Why This Work Matters</h2>

      <p>Grooming is rarely a single moment.<br /><strong>It is a process.</strong></p>

      <p>A psychological, emotional, and behavioural escalation that thrives on silence, confusion, power imbalance, and institutional inertia.</p>

      <p>Most survivors are not believed the first time they speak.<br />Many are never believed at all.</p>

      <h3>The Grooming Files exists to:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Document what survivors were never allowed to say</li>
        <li>Show how grooming patterns repeat across cases</li>
        <li>Challenge safeguarding myths and media oversimplification</li>
        <li>Push for earlier recognition, better prevention, and real accountability</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>This work is often uncomfortable.<br />That is intentional.</em></p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Ethics & Boundaries</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>All survivor submissions are <strong>18+ only</strong></li>
        <li>Anonymous submissions are protected</li>
        <li>Identifiers are removed unless explicit consent is given</li>
        <li>Legal and ethical considerations are prioritised</li>
        <li>No content is published for shock value</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>This platform is survivor-led, not trauma-extractive.</strong></p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Beyond The Grooming Files</h2>

      <p>Alongside investigative journalism, I also develop trauma-integration and shadow-work frameworks through <strong>Shadowborn</strong>, a separate transformation platform.</p>

      <p>While the two bodies of work are distinct, they share a core foundation:<br /><em>pattern recognition, truth-telling, and a refusal to look away.</em></p>

      <p>I am not interested in being palatable.<br /><strong>I am interested in being accurate.</strong></p>
