## A s*urvivor-led investigation into how pornography grooms minds, escalates harm, and fuels sexual offending.*

---

## **About the Series**

Porn isn’t harmless entertainment. It’s a multi-billion-pound industry that grooms minds, rewires desire, and shapes sexual behaviour, often before people even understand what sex is.

In this 8-part investigation, I expose how porn drives sexual harm, fuels the formation of offenders, normalises abuse and how we can fight back.
