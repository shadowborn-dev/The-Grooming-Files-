## This 12-part series breaks down the major predator types operating across society, from the opportunists and groomers to the ideologues and enablers.

Each article exposes a different mindset, method, and systemic failure, written from a survivor-informed, forensic lens. These aren’t just profiles. They’re warnings.

Every type is real. Every tactic has been used. And every failure to name them enables more harm.

***Read, share, and stay aware.***
***🩸 Knowledge is protection. Silence is permission.***

## **You’ve Now Met Them All. What Happens Next Is Up to Us.**

These aren’t just stories.
They’re real patterns, real tactics, and real failures that allow predators to keep offending, while victims are left to explain themselves.

**We can’t fix what we won’t name.**
And we won’t protect the next generation by pretending it’s only “monsters” we need to watch for.

If you learned something, share it.
If it hit too close, sit with it.
If it made you angry, good! 
That means you’re awake.

🩸 We don’t fear predators here.
We expose them.
