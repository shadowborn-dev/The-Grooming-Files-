## What is The Grooming Files?

📢 Exposing the Truth. Giving Survivors a Voice.

For years, online grooming has been ignored, dismissed, or misunderstood. Many of us—especially those who grew up in the early internet era—were unprotected, unaware, and left to navigate online dangers alone.

#### Now, we’re speaking out.

The Grooming Files is a survivor-led movement dedicated to:
✔️ Giving survivors a platform to be heard (anonymously or openly)
✔️ Educating on how grooming worked then vs. now
✔️ Pushing for better awareness, resources, and safeguarding measures
✔️ Challenging the media’s narrative with real voices & real stories

### Why This Matters

❌ Over 85% of online grooming cases go unreported.
❌ Many survivors never realise they were groomed until years later.
❌ The dangers of online predators haven’t stopped—they’ve evolved.

🗣️ We are survivors. We are speaking up. We are taking back our voices.

💡 Through The Grooming Files, we’ll be sharing:
🔹 **Survivor stories –** First-hand experiences from those who lived it
🔹 **In-depth articles –** Breaking down how online grooming worked (then & now)
🔹 **Podcasts & discussions** – Talking with survivors, experts, and advocates
🔹 **Awareness campaigns** – Making this issue impossible to ignore

📢 **This isn’t just a story—it’s history that needs to be told.**
