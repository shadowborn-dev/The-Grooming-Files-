## 🖤

Welcome to **Shadowborn**, a seven-part series born not from theory, but from fire.

This is not your average healing journey. No toxic positivity. No spiritual bypassing.

This is raw, soul-deep survival, a mirror for every survivor who’s walked through hell and clawed their way back to breath.

Each part is a chapter of real becoming, the kind you won’t find in self-help books.

If you’ve ever felt too broken, too lost, or too angry to be healed… this is for you.

## 🖤 Why Shadowborn?

Because we didn’t heal in the light. We healed in the dark.

We weren’t led, we were broken open.

We weren’t saved, we saved ourselves.

This series isn’t a roadmap. It’s a reflection.

A survival chant.

A soul guide for those still crawling, still raging, still rising.

**We are the Shadowborn and we are not done.**
