## This is a Breeding Ground — And We Need to Stop It Now

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000021861f9acfc3c1b66c9c1582500594572455704638.png?w=1024)

Before you dive into the full series, this personal reflection lays bare what it felt like behind the scenes — when a predator asked to be stopped, and the system stayed quiet. This isn’t just about one man, one system, or one miss.
It’s a breeding ground — and we’re watching it grow in silence.

“I am a danger to children,” he told me. “Only jail, constant monitoring and public shaming would stop me.”

This wasn’t a sting. He came to me voluntarily — begging to be stopped. Not once. Twice. Two predators, two countries, one terrifying pattern. When they confess to journalists because they know the system won’t stop them — that’s not justice. That’s failure.

“I want to be exposed,” isn’t a confession. It’s a red flag.

These predators aren’t showing remorse. They’re spiralling — and they know it. Fantasies intensify. Guilt builds. And then, they seek exposure — not to protect children, but to protect themselves. And the system still doesn’t step in.

Exposure groups are incredible — but they were never built for this.

Predators in escalation mode are showing up voluntarily. They bypass sting models. They come untriggered — spiralling, dangerous, and unchecked. The police aren’t acting. And some of the worst offenders? Still free.

“I’d rape a child if I had the chance,” he told me. And after the interview? He backpedalled.

These men don’t want healing. They want control. They confess. Then they deny. They spiral — and ask me to monitor them. I’ve sat face to face with what most will never hear. And I’m telling you: the system is not ready.
