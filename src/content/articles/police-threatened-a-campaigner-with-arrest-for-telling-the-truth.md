## When does telling the truth become a crime?

That’s the question being asked this week after West Midlands Police allegedly threatened Predator Awareness founder Tom Blewitt with **arrest over a factual online post**.

Tom had shared evidence-based information, content he stands behind and can prove. But instead of engagement or challenge, he received a phone call that has since sent ripples through the advocacy community.

---

## “Take it down — or face arrest”

During the call, which Tom states was recorded, an officer reportedly told him:

*"If you don’t remove the post, we will arrest you."*

No formal charge. No warrant. No demonstrated breach of law, just an ultimatum. Remove the post, or risk losing your liberty.

Tom is now seeking legal advice and standing firm.

---

### What was in the post?

The post in question contained material Tom believed to be both **truthful** and **in the public interest**.

It did not include threats, abuse, or targeted harassment, the elements typically required to meet the legal threshold for a “malicious communications” offence.

It was, simply, a piece of advocacy, the kind of speech protected by both UK law and basic human rights standards.

---

## The wider danger

Threatening campaigners or journalists with **arrest for publishing verified information** is not just a legal overstep. It’s an attack on public interest speech itself.

When officers issue ultimatums like this without court oversight or formal charge, they risk eroding both **free expression** and **public trust in policing**.

Malicious communications laws were never intended to shield uncomfortable truths from public view.

## Statement from Predator Awareness

In a statement, Predator Awareness said:

> 
> *“The post in question contained factual information supported by evidence. We ask, since when has telling the truth become a criminal offence in this country?”*
> 
> 
> 

The team now say they will not be silenced and that legal guidance is ongoing.

## Why this matters

Today it’s Tom. Tomorrow it could be any campaigner, survivor, or independent journalist.

These kinds of tactics, whether deliberate or misguided, have a chilling effect. They make people think twice before speaking out. They sow fear where there should be debate.

And in a democracy, that’s dangerous ground.

---

### We will be following this situation closely. Police must be held to standards of **proportionality**, **fairness**, and **respect for public interest speech**.

Because when truth starts being treated as a crime, we all lose.
