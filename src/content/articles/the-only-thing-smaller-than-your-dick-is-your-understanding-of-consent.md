**I Opened My Inbox—and Found His Dick. Again.**

I wasn’t scrolling Pornhub. I wasn’t sexting. I was opening a standard Facebook message — only to be greeted by *his dick*. Again.

Same man. Same unasked-for limp gladiator. But this time? He levelled up. A full wank video.

Not a flirty text. Not a misread vibe. A man who thought it was totally fine to film himself, get his dick out, and send it to me.

**Without consent.**

---

## **This Isn’t Sexting. This Is Cyberflashing.**

Let’s be crystal clear: sending unsolicited sexual images or videos is not a joke. It’s not “just banter.” It’s not “just how men are.”

It’s **cyberflashing**.
And it’s a **criminal offence**.

Under the Online Safety Act 2023, it is **illegal** to send sexual images to someone without their clear, *enthusiastic*, *explicit* consent. It doesn’t matter if you’re lonely, horny, or just plain thick. You’re committing a criminal offence — one that can carry up to **2 years in prison**.

Still feel like pressing send?

## **Repeat Offender. Full Receipts. No Mercy.**

This wasn’t the first time this man sent me his shrivelled dick like he thought it deserved a standing ovation.

Last time, I laughed. Gave him a chance to crawl away.

But now?

He’s earned the main stage.

So here it is:
**His name. His face. His filth.**

He *exposed* himself to me. So I’m *exposing* him right back.

## **Why This Matters: Power, Control, and the Digital Playground for Pervs**

Let’s not pretend this is rare.
It’s not about attraction. It’s about **control**.

It’s about men treating women’s inboxes like a peep show.
It’s about entitlement and a complete detachment from reality.
It’s about how our bodies are *still* being treated like open access — even through a screen.

Women are logging off.
Teen girls are deleting apps.
Survivors are being retraumatised in silence.

And me?
I’m making noise.

## **To Survivors, Fighters, and the Silent Watchers**

This is not just happening to you.
You are not being dramatic.
You are not “asking for it.”
You are not alone.

You’re allowed to name them.
You’re allowed to protect your peace.
You’re allowed to say — loudly, clearly, and publicly:

**“The only thing smaller than your dick is your understanding of consent.”**

---

**Platforms? Do better.**
**Law enforcement? Wake up.**
**Men with cameras and no shame? Try therapy.**

Because if this is how you flirt — your next match might just be with the Sex Offenders Register.

I’m done.
He’s exposed (literally!)
