Campaigners gathered outside HMP Swansea on Saturday to raise awareness of systemic failings inside Welsh prisons, amid mounting concerns over deaths in custody, staff misconduct, and widespread drug abuse. The demonstration was supported by public figures, former inmates, and grassroots prison reform advocates determined to expose what they describe as a “crisis hidden in plain sight”.

Tom Blewitt, a prominent campaigner for prison accountability, delivered  passionate speeches addressing the conditions inside both HMP Swansea and HMP Parc.

The event featured a live performance by social media personality **Andrew “Biggie” Morris**, who lent his platform and voice to the cause. **Cullan Mais**, known for his work in addiction recovery and through *The Central Club Podcast*, also attended briefly and spoke with organisers.

One of the most significant developments came from direct testimony shared by **recently released prisoners** from HMP Swansea and HMP Parc, who spoke openly to campaigners during the demonstration. Their accounts painted a disturbing picture of daily life inside.

> 
> “There are more drugs in there than on the street,” said one former inmate.
> “Screws are bringing it in — hiding it in donuts.”
> “People are constantly in debt. It’s violence every day. People overdosing weekly. And the screws are beating people too.”
>

These accounts echo concerns raised by families and whistleblowers in recent months. Campaigners say the situation in Welsh prisons is deteriorating, and that those on the inside, especially the most vulnerable, are paying the price.

According to official figures, **at least 42 people have died in Welsh prisons in recent years**, raising serious questions about institutional safeguards and duty of care. In addition to the reported drug trafficking by staff, allegations include **sexual assaults on vulnerable prisoners**, unchecked violence, and a management culture that **“turns a blind eye”**.

Campaigners also highlighted ongoing concerns with **South Wales Police**, accusing the force of failing to properly investigate staff misconduct and shielding institutional wrongdoing across the justice system.

The demonstration is part of a growing grassroots effort calling for prison reform, independent scrutiny, and stronger protections for those in custody. Organisers say the movement will continue to amplify unheard voices, expose abuses, and push for full transparency across the system.
