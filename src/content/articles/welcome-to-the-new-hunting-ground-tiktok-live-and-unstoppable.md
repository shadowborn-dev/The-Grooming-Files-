### You want to know where the predators went?

You want to know where the grooming happens now?

**Scroll TikTok after midnight.**

**I dare you! **

It doesn’t creep in through hidden forums anymore.
It doesn't whisper from the dark corners of the internet.
It dances under ring lights.
It giggles through filters.
It smiles for hearts and clout and money.

---

A few nights ago, I was scrolling.
Not even looking for anything.
Just mindless, half-asleep.
Like everyone else.

And then it hit me.
Like a fist.
Like a memory.

Because when you know,
you just fucking know.

---

There he was.
Mid-40s, easy.
Grinning like the harmless dad he wasn’t.
Two girls — children, not even old enough to drive — sitting there on live with him.

Laughing.
Chatting.
"Casual."

If you hadn't lived it, you wouldn't see it.
If you hadn't survived it, you’d think it was “sweet.”
If you hadn’t bled for it, you might have even clicked 'Like.'

But I stayed.
I watched.
I listened.

And the way he reeled them in —
**Jesus Christ.**

Praise disguised as friendship.
Laughter sharpened into loyalty.
The slow, steady binding of souls through a fucking screen.

I reported him, of course.
Maybe TikTok cared.
Maybe not.

But as I kept scrolling, the sickness spread.
One live.
Two lives.
Ten lives.
An entire goddamn marketplace of monsters and kids.

The screen turned into a graveyard.
Smiling.
Lip-syncing.
Begging for attention.
Selling their childhoods for validation.

**Selling their souls to the devil.**

And no one was stopping it.
Not the platform.
Not the watchers.
Not the parents asleep upstairs.

Just dead-eyed scrolling.
Just stupid fucking emojis.
Just predators out in the open — hunting — rewarded with hearts.

TikTok is not a safe space.
Instagram is not a playground.
Snapchat is not innocent.

The predators aren't hiding anymore.
They don't need to.

We gave them the stage.
We built them the audience.
We handed them the children.

And we called it "engagement."

---

Grooming today isn't a secret crime.
It's a business model.
It’s an industry.
It’s content.

It’s a 14-year-old girl laughing on a Live with a man three times her age — while 300 strangers send hearts and nobody says a word.

It’s a predator building "clout" by pretending to be a "mentor."

It’s a child believing the lie that love is measured in likes.

---

If you think this is rare,
You are the problem.
If you think this is "over there,"
You are the silence that predators thrive in.
If you think reporting once is enough,
You are part of the machine that keeps grinding girls into ghosts.

---

It’s an epidemic.
It’s right now.
It’s live.

And if you don’t see it,
It’s because you don’t want to.

# The new hunting ground is here.

And it's wearing a filter.

# Welcome to hell.

You built it.
You fund it.
You watch it.
Now look.
Don’t you fucking dare look away.
