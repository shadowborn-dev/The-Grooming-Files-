## **Police Enter Property During Recording**

**Tredegar, Wales –** A dramatic confrontation unfolded this morning at **Roseland Bed & Breakfast**, where **Dank Dragon Exposure** confronted a man identified as **Daffyd Palfrey** over alleged inappropriate online activity.

The sting, **streamed live on social media**, quickly escalated when **Palfrey’s father physically attacked members of the group and made threats of gun violence.**

As tensions rose, **police arrived with three patrol cars and entered the property while the live recording was still ongoing.**

---

### **The Confrontation: Denial and Evidence**

Dank Dragon Exposure, a well-known group dedicated to **exposing online predators**, arrived at **Roseland B&B** to confront **Daffyd**, presenting what they claimed was **clear evidence** of inappropriate conversations.

However, **Palfrey denied all allegations**, insisting he had been **hacked**—a **common defense often seen in similar cases.**

As a member of **Dank Dragon** continued questioning **Palfrey**, the situation **quickly escalated** when his **father came outside in an apparent rage.**

---

### **Violence, Shotgun Threats & Police Involvement**

Eyewitnesses watching the **live sting** saw **Palfrey’s father physically attack members of Dank Dragon.**

During the altercation, he **threatened to “blow their heads off with a shotgun.”**

Shortly after, **three police cars arrived at the scene**, and **officers entered the property** while the **live recording continued.**

At this time, it is **unclear whether any arrests were made**, but **police intervention suggests that both the allegations against Palfrey and his father’s violent threats are now under investigation.**

### **Who Are Dank Dragon?**

Dank Dragon is an **independent group** that conducts **sting operations** to expose online predators.

They work with **decoys posing as minors**, gathering evidence and confronting individuals in **live-streamed stings.**

While their actions have drawn **praise from supporters**, they have also faced **criticism** for potentially interfering with police investigations.

---

### **Why Exposure Teams Matter**

There is no question that **more needs to be done to keep children safe** from online predators.

**Groups like Dank Dragon play a critical role in exposing those who seek to harm minors**—and their efforts are essential in a system where too many cases **slip through the cracks.**

The work of exposure teams should not be **undermined or dismissed**—it should spark a larger conversation about **why these groups exist in the first place** and what more can be done at **a legal and community level** to protect vulnerable children.

---

### **What Happens Next?**

With **police now actively involved**, an **official investigation** is likely.

Potential outcomes could include:
✔ **Criminal charges against Palfrey** if sufficient evidence is found.
