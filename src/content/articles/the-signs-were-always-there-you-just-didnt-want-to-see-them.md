It wasn’t hidden.
It wasn’t subtle.
It wasn’t buried deep where no one could find it.

**It was happening right in front of you.**

---

The signs were there:

- Kids shrinking in themselves, going silent.

- Sudden new "friends" they couldn’t explain.

- Phone screens turned quickly away.

- Innocence draining out of smiles that used to be real.

The signs were there:

- Teachers "missing" the obvious.

- Parents looking the other way.

- Authorities writing off cries for help as "attention seeking."

The signs were there:

- Adults ignoring their gut feelings because facing the truth was harder than pretending nothing was wrong.

It wasn’t invisible.
It was inconvenient.

And so you chose to look away.

You told yourselves it was just a phase.
You told yourselves they were being dramatic.
You told yourselves good people don’t do bad things.
You wrapped yourself in comfortable lies because the truth would have cost too much to face.

---

Survivors didn’t get that luxury.
We didn’t get to look away.
We lived inside it.

We felt the wrongness clinging to our skin long before the world was willing to name it.
We sensed the danger in smiles that came with strings attached.
We read between the lines you refused to read.

---

We weren’t naive.
We weren’t wild.
We weren’t broken toys waiting to be played with.

**We were children navigating a world that chose its own comfort over our safety.**

You didn’t miss the signs.
**You ignored them.**

Because facing them would have forced you to admit that the systems you trusted — the schools, the families, the communities — were not safe after all.

Because facing them would have forced you to act.
And acting would have cost you.

---

So don’t tell us now that you "had no idea."
Don’t tell us it was too well hidden.
Don’t tell us you’re shocked.

You weren’t blind.
You chose blindness.

You weren’t powerless.
You chose silence.

---

And we — the survivors you tried not to see —
We saw it all.

We always did.
