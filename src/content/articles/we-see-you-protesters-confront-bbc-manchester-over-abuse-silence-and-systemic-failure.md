Right now, outside the gleaming front of BBC Manchester, a protest burns—not in numbers, but in unshakable passion.

**Predator Awareness**, **HMP Prisons Justice Group**, and **The Masked Truth** have come together in a joint demonstration that may be small in scale—but the message is colossal: *You hid them. You knew. And we are not staying silent.*

From midday, campaigners stood tall with placards, truth, and purpose. BBC staff reportedly tried to block them from putting up posters—an act that only fuelled the fire already burning among those present. A handful of BBC employees stood outside, watching, silent.

Two powerful speeches have already been delivered—
**Tom**, founder of Predator Awareness, spoke with fury and clarity about the BBC’s dark legacy and the broader system that protects predators.
**Zack**, leading HMP Prisons Justice Group, followed with words that hit just as hard. 

Both speeches are streaming live via Predator Awareness channels, with more expected throughout the day.

Police were meant to attend. They haven’t shown up. But that absence speaks volumes.

This protest is not performative. It’s purposeful. The energy on the ground is not for show—it’s survival, it’s truth, it’s refusal to look away any longer.

In a country where institutions are protected while survivors are ignored, today’s action—however modest in size—is nothing short of seismic.
