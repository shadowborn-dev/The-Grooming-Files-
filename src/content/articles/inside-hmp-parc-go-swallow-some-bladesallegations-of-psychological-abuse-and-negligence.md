We’ve received serious allegations from inside **X2 wing at HMP Parc**, raising fresh concerns over psychological abuse, staff misconduct, and repeated safeguarding failures.

According to a trusted source, two young offenders asked a prison officer for a replacement television after theirs broke. The request was denied. In response, the pair allegedly placed a handwritten note in their window referencing the officer.

That night, it’s claimed the officer returned and spent hours deliberately banging on their cell door, keeping them awake — and reportedly shouted at them to:

> 
> **“Go swallow some blades.”**
> 
> 
> 

The following day, one of the individuals, known to be under ACT monitoring for self-harm risk. Allegedly entered the dinner queue with a blade and began cutting himself in front of others.

Several staff members were reportedly present. One officer allegedly remained seated and unresponsive. Another eventually intervened and managed to safely disarm the individual.

What was said next is even more disturbing.

The source claims the young man told staff the blade had been **given to him the night before by the same officer** who had been banging on the door. If accurate, this would represent a serious breach of policy, especially given that this individual is not permitted access to sharps.

We are treating these statements as **allegations**. However, if verified, they point to a dangerous culture on X2 wing: one where vulnerable prisoners are provoked, neglected, and placed at risk by those meant to oversee their welfare.

We continue to gather information and remain open to further testimony from anyone with knowledge of the incident.
