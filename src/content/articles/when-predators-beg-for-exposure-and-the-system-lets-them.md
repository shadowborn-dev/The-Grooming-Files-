## In 2025, two men messaged me out of the blue.

They weren’t groomers pretending to be something else.
They weren’t trying to cover their tracks.
They told me outright:

> 
> “I’m a danger to children.”
> “I want to be exposed.”
> “I can’t stop myself. Please hold me.”
> 
> 
> 

They didn’t run.
They spiralled toward shame — as if shame might save them.

And when I, a survivor-journalist, responded — they clung to me like I was a lifeline.

Not because I offered therapy.
Not because I made them feel better.
But because I mirrored them back to themselves.
Because I punished with truth.
Because I structured their chaos with consequence.

## This isn’t just a story. It’s a pattern.

They didn’t want healing.
They wanted surveillance. Shame. Structure.
They wanted to be watched, exposed, punished, and contained.

And when I built a system to hold one of them — he submitted to it fully.
When I shut it down, he begged for it back.

They didn’t need a friend. They needed a cage.
And I, somehow, became the last one holding the keys.

---

## I’ve documented it all.

Every message.
Every confession.
Every escalation.

This is *The Predator Paradox* — and the full exposé + forensic psychological report are now live for subscribers.

If you work in safeguarding, psychology, law enforcement, survivor support, or journalism — **you need to read this.**

Because if we don’t name this pattern now,
we’re going to miss what’s coming next.
