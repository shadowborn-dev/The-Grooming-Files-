## ***The Porn Crisis***

### *What happens when a child’s first sexual experience… isn’t theirs*?

---

It doesn’t start with desire.
It starts with exposure.

A pop-up.
A schoolmate’s phone.
A search out of curiosity that opens a door they can’t close.

**And what they see isn’t love, isn’t trust, and isn’t sex.**
It’s performance. Pain. Control.

It’s porn.

---

## What does that do to a developing brain?

Children exposed to pornography before puberty are:

- More likely to show reduced empathy and increased aggression

- More likely to normalise violence, submission, and silence in sexual scripts

- At risk of developing compulsive sexual behaviours or unrealistic expectations

> 
> Owens et al. (2012) found that early exposure is linked to greater sexual permissiveness and objectification.
> Flood (2007) warned that children struggle to distinguish between fantasy and real-life sexual relationships.

This isn’t education, it’s programming.

---

## This is not rare. It’s everywhere.

- In the UK, over 50% of 11–13-year-olds have seen pornography online.

- One in ten under 10s have already been exposed.

- Most kids see porn years before any formal sex education.

No consent. No preparation. No understanding.
Just confusion, arousal, shame and silence.

**That’s not curiosity. That’s grooming.**

---

## The loop begins early:

- **Stimulus:** The first video — shocking, arousing, taboo

- **Secrecy:** They say nothing, but remember everything

- **Shame:** They feel confused, maybe dirty — but go back anyway

- **Escalation:** Curiosity becomes compulsion.

- **Normalisation:** Violence, degradation, silence become “just what sex is”

This is how a child’s sexuality is shaped, not by connection or love,
but by code, algorithms, and monetised fantasy.

---

## This is the pipeline no one wants to admit:

- Exposure at 10

- Habit by 12

- Escalation by 14

- Confusion, addiction, desensitisation

- And for some? Acting out. Testing boundaries. Crossing lines.

We’re not saying porn causes offending.
We’re saying it can **create the conditions** where offending becomes more likely, especially in children already struggling with trauma, identity, or impulse control.

---

## This isn’t harmless. It’s strategic.

If you wanted to groom a generation into confusion, objectification, and disconnection…
**this is exactly how you’d do it.**

And the industry knows it.
