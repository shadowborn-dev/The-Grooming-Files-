## ***The Porn Crisis***

### *We know the damage. So why isn’t anyone stopping it*?

---

We’ve laid it bare.

Porn is grooming young minds.
It’s warping desire, escalating compulsion, fuelling harm.

And yet... 
**no one’s stopping it.**

Not the tech giants.
Not the safeguarding bodies.
Not the schools.
Not the government.

Because porn is protected.
**Not despite the harm**,** but because of what the silence protects.**

---

## Porn is too profitable to challenge

The global porn industry is worth over **£90 billion** and its business model *relies on harm*:

- **Free access = mass traffic**

- **Escalation = engagement**

- **Engagement = profit**

- **Shame = silence**

Sites like **Pornhub**, **XVideos**, and **XHamster** dominate global traffic.
And they’ve been caught, repeatedly, hosting:

- Non-consensual content

- Child sexual abuse

- Trafficking victims

- Deepfakes of underage girls

> 
> In 2020, Pornhub faced a major lawsuit for hosting videos of exploited minors. Visa and Mastercard cut ties. But years later?
> **The site’s still up. The money’s still flowing. The content’s still being pushed.**
> 
> 
> 

No regulation. No accountability.
Because **regulation hurts profit and profit rules policy.**

---

## Schools aren’t silent — they’re *distracted*

Sex education in the UK has become a battlefield of ideology, not protection.

Kids are being taught:

- Gender identity theory at age 6

- How to masturbate by age 9

- “Sex positivity” without critical literacy

- That questioning porn is “sex-negative” or “judgmental”

Meanwhile:

- **No one’s teaching them about consent**

- **No one’s showing them how porn distorts real intimacy**

- **No one’s explaining how grooming really works**

> 
> In some schools, teachers are told *not to criticise violent porn*, in case it “shames students’ preferences.”
> 
> 
> 

We’ve got a generation who know 37 genders 
but think choking, silence, and filming is just what sex is.

This isn’t sex ed.
It’s **abandonment disguised as progress.**

---

## Safeguarding systems are stuck in the past

The entire safeguarding model is built for:

- Stranger danger

- Historic abuse

- “Known risks”

But modern porn-fuelled harm doesn’t look like that.

Today’s cases involve:

- Children filming porn in school toilets

- Sextortion at age 12

- Exposure-seeking predators begging to be caught

- Offenders who were groomed *by the algorithm*, not a person

And the safeguarding system?
**Has no framework for any of it.**

> 
> Where are the social workers?
> Where are the psychologists?
> Where are the experts who said “never again”?
> 
> 
> 

They’re sitting behind policy handbooks that haven’t been updated in 15 years.
**And it shows.**

---

## Governments avoid it — because it’s useful

Porn doesn’t just entertain.
It sedates.
It isolates.
It makes people easier to distract, control, and sell to.

- **Connection dies**

- **Intimacy breaks down**

- **Families fracture**

- **Desire gets commodified**

The state doesn’t want sexual sovereignty.
It wants silence. Submission. Shame.

**And porn delivers.**

---

## So the silence continues — by design

Who benefits?

- **Tech companies** making ad revenue off your shame

- **Schools** avoiding backlash by staying vague

- **Governments** pacifying the public

- **Predators** who slip through the cracks

- **Porn sites** who profit off every child that clicks

Who suffers?

- The kids

- The survivors

- The disconnected

- The ones who escalate

- The ones who get caught up in it all — and never get out

---

## This isn’t neglect. It’s strategy.

And we are calling it what it is: **A coordinated, cowardly silence that sacrifices truth to protect profit.**

We see it.
We name it.
We’re done waiting for permission to speak.
