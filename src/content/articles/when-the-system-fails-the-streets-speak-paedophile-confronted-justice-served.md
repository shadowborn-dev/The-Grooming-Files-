One Less Predator, One More Broken System

### L**et’s not sugar-coat it.**

When I saw the headline — ***“Man confronted by paedophile hunters found dead on motorway”*** — my gut reaction wasn’t horror. It was something far more complicated. Relief? Closure? Maybe even justice?

I know how that sounds to some. “That’s someone’s son… husband… father.” Yes, it is. But when you’ve lived through grooming, manipulation, and the lifelong scars predators leave behind, you start to see justice through a different lens — one shaped by silence, disbelief, and a system that’s failed us far too often.

The man in question, Adrian Smith, was confronted during a livestream by a paedophile hunter group. He was arrested that same night and released the next day. A few hours later, he was found dead on the M4. Multiple injuries. No family concerns reported. And the coroner’s inquest is set for June.

The press calls it a tragedy.
I call it a turning point.

### **The System Has a Pattern — and It Isn’t Protecting Us**

This isn’t new.

Predators get exposed, arrested… then bailed. Sometimes they’re never charged. Sometimes they get a suspended sentence. Sometimes, they walk free entirely because the “evidence wasn’t strong enough,” or the police “couldn’t proceed.”

And we, the victims, are left holding the trauma — and the silence.
No justice. No closure. Just shame, fear, and the hope that next time, maybe someone will believe us sooner.

So when sting groups take action, I understand it.
Because sometimes that’s the **only** time we see any form of accountability — even if it’s livestreamed on Facebook instead of heard in court.

---

### **Online Hunters or Underground Justice?**

People call them vigilantes. Some call them dangerous. But let’s be real: what’s more dangerous — citizens trying to expose a predator, or institutions failing to stop them?

These groups don’t always get it right. But when they do, they give something that victims rarely get: **visibility**.

They don’t wait years for a trial. They don’t lose evidence. They don’t prioritise the offender’s reputation over a child’s safety.

In a world where we’ve seen repeat offenders ruin lives again and again while the system shrugs, is it any wonder that so many people quietly support these stings?

---

### **Was It Justice? Depends Who You Ask.**

Did Adrian Smith deserve a fair trial? Maybe.
But where was “fair” when so many of us never got to tell our stories in the first place?
Where was fairness when our abusers got a slap on the wrist, or nothing at all?

We’re told not to judge. We’re told to let the system work. But we’ve been letting it “work” for decades — and it’s still letting predators slip through, reoffend, and destroy lives.

So yes, when I heard that he wouldn’t get the chance to groom another child, I felt something that looked a lot like justice.
Unfinished. Unclean. But justice nonetheless.

---

### **We’re Not Supposed to Say It — But We Think It**

Survivors are always expected to be polite. Grateful. Calm.
We’re expected to trust a system that has ignored us, minimised us, and protected our abusers.
We’re told “innocent until proven guilty” like it’s a universal truth, even when the evidence is plain to see on screen.

But here’s the truth no one likes to hear:

**Sometimes we feel safer when they’re gone.**
Sometimes, we feel peace when we know one more predator won’t reoffend.
Sometimes, justice happens outside a courtroom — and we’re okay with that.

---

### **A Final Thought from Someone Who Lived It**

I don’t celebrate death. I don’t take joy in suffering.
But I won’t lie and say I’m mourning either.

What I mourn is every child who wasn’t believed. Every survivor who stayed silent. Every case that went nowhere. Every predator who walked free.

Adrian Smith may not have faced a judge. But in the eyes of many — especially those of us who’ve lived through the worst — he faced something else: the weight of his own actions.
And in this broken world, that may be the closest thing to justice we ever get.

---

Written with the voices of the unheard.
For the survivors still waiting.
For those who were never given a courtroom.
For those who never made it out.
