## Founder Dan Brown (aka Daniel Murray / David Barker)

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fb_img_17439741027986934257440637058943.jpg?w=1010)

**Disclaimer:** This article is based on personal experience, multiple anonymous conversations, publicly available sources, and observed behaviour. It is written in good faith, in the public interest, and with the intention of protecting vulnerable individuals from potential harm. All individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, and any corrections will be issued if new evidence arises.

When I joined *The Masked Truth* on March 19th, I expected to be part of a group rooted in advocacy, truth-telling, and justice for vulnerable people. What I found instead was something darker: a pattern of manipulation, exploitation, and abuse hiding in plain sight.

The group was founded in April 2023 by a man who calls himself **Dan Brown**, also known online as **Daniel Murray**. His real name, however, is **David Barker**. Based in South Shields, Barker presents himself as an advocate for victims, particularly those fighting in the family courts. But through personal observation and multiple accounts shared confidentially, serious concerns have emerged around his conduct.

---

### **THE PATTERN**

Since its inception, *The Masked Truth* has attracted many women facing immense personal battles: survivors of domestic abuse, mothers in family court, women with trauma, mental health conditions, and neurodivergent diagnoses like ASD and ADHD. These are individuals seeking help, solidarity, and safety.

Instead, according to a pattern observed by multiple members and others connected to the group, many were met with inappropriate and harmful conduct.

Over time, it became apparent that Barker was developing personal and sometimes romantic entanglements with a number of vulnerable individuals connected to the group. In one case, he maintained contact with someone for months, building emotional intimacy online. Shortly after, he was allegedly involved with another person within the same circle. These overlapping dynamics created tension, confusion, and emotional fallout for those involved.

A former member I spoke with privately described him as dangerous, manipulative, and calculated. The charm, she explained, was a mask. The kindness, a hook. Once she saw behind it, everything changed.

Others, speaking off-record, have echoed similar sentiments. They have since distanced themselves entirely from both the group and Barker.

### **CONTROL AND DOCUMENT WITHHOLDING**

*The Masked Truth* claims to help members with social services and family court issues. One woman, referred to here as Lacey (name changed for protection), privately shared that she trusted Dan with her **Subject Access Request (SAR)** documents — sensitive files containing personal and legal information. She handed them over believing it was part of the group’s support process.

It is understood that those documents were never returned. She says Barker initially promised to return them in person, but then blocked her on all platforms. It is further alleged he later denied ever having them. If true, these actions could severely impact her legal standing and personal safety.

### **DISTURBING SEXUAL CLAIMS**

A former team member has privately alleged that Barker discussed being involved in **breath play**, including acts involving bags over women’s heads. Whether consensual or not, these acts carry serious psychological and physical risks, especially when occurring in contexts involving previously traumatised individuals. These claims remain unverified but are deeply concerning in light of other behavioural patterns.

---

### **BULLYING AND SILENCING**

During my brief time in the group (I was removed on March 31st), I observed a toxic dynamic forming. One individual  – was bullying another vulnerable member with ASD and ADHD. Barker did not intervene. His lack of leadership or safeguarding appeared to enable the behaviour.

When I personally challenged the bullying and stood up for the neurodivergent woman being targeted, I was promptly kicked from the group myself. That, more than anything, confirmed what I already suspected — this wasn’t a safe space. It was a controlled space.

In private, it has been alleged that when concerns were raised internally about these dynamics, those individuals were met with deflection, blame, or removal. One person said they were accused of harassment shortly after questioning the direction of the group.

### **PUBLIC RECORDS AND PAST BEHAVIOUR**

*A man named David Barker, of a similar age and from the same area, was convicted of domestic abuse in 2019, as reported by the Sunderland Echo. While it has not been officially confirmed this is the same individual, the similarities have raised questions in light of wider allegations.

This adds further concern to the growing allegations about his behaviour within advocacy circles.

*Update added to clarify one detail re: public record report. The rest of the article remains fully supported by direct evidence and screenshots.

### **THIS ISN’T DRAMA. THIS IS DANGEROUS.**

This article is not about failed relationships or personal disputes. It is about a growing body of concern that David Barker is using his platform for power, access, and influence over vulnerable women. Multiple individuals have raised quiet alarms about emotional manipulation, romantic entanglement, and the blurring of advocacy with control.

To anyone still involved: trust your instincts. And to those who’ve walked away: your voice matters. You were not overreacting.

David Barker, aka Daniel Murray, aka Dan Brown — if these concerns are to be believed, you have used your mask for long enough.

We see you now.
