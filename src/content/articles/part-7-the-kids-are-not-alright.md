## ***The Porn Crisis***

### *This isn’t curiosity. It’s *collapse.

---

They’re not exploring.
They’re not experimenting.
They’re not just “growing up in a digital world.”

**They’re being raised by porn.**
And they’re mimicking what they see, without understanding any of it.

---

## What we’re seeing in real time:

- Girls as young as 11 being blackmailed over nudes

- Boys choking partners by age 13 and calling it “normal”

- Kids filming sexual content of each other in school toilets

- Children mimicking violent porn before they even understand what sex is

> 
> In 2023, the NSPCC reported a sharp rise in **sextortion cases involving children under 14**.
> In multiple UK schools, girls reported being pressured to send “OnlyFans-style” content to classmates.
> In 2024, teachers raised alarm after a 12-year-old boy described “choking his girlfriend because he saw it online.”
> 
> 
> 

This isn’t experimentation.
**It’s imitation. Desensitisation. Escalation.**

---

## Porn has replaced sex ed — and it’s teaching all the wrong lessons:

- **Sex = performance**

- **Pleasure = pain**

- **Consent = silence**

- **Bodies = currency**

- **Boundaries = optional**

Children are copying what they see online.
And what they see is aggression.
Domination. Fake orgasms. Choking. Humiliation. Silence.

Not love. Not trust.
**Not safety.**

---

## This is how a generation gets groomed — without anyone laying a hand.

- The algorithm shows them violent porn

- Shame keeps them from talking

- Peer culture turns abuse into content

- Sextortion locks them in silence

By the time they understand what’s happened, the damage is done:

- Trust issues

- Body hatred

- Sexual dysfunction

- Dissociation

- Grooming normalisation

**And not one adult stopped it.**

---

## Schools aren’t protecting them.

They’re busy pushing ideology over reality.

Kids are taught to label themselves.
But not to spot coercion.
They can identify 10 sexual orientation.... 
but can’t define *enthusiastic consent*.

They’re told how to express identity, but not how to protect it.

---

## And the adults aren’t seeing it — until it’s too late.

Because this harm doesn’t always scream.
Sometimes it smiles.
Sometimes it posts.
Sometimes it says nothing.

> “He said everyone does it.”
> “I didn’t know I could say no.”

This is the next generation, 
And they’re being broken from the inside out.

---

## This is the fallout.

- Porn isn’t just harming children.

- It’s *shaping them*.

- It’s grooming their expectations, desires, and responses.

- And it’s doing it younger, faster, and more violently than ever.

We can’t pretend this is curiosity anymore.
**It’s crisis.**
