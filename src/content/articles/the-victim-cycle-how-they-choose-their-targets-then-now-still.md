#### They didn’t choose victims at random back then.
**And they don’t now.**

**They know what to look for.**
They know who’s vulnerable.
They know who won’t be believed.
They know exactly how to test, manipulate, and trap.

**It was calculated then. It’s calculated now.**

And the scariest part?
**It’s all still happening—in plain sight, online and offline, just like it always was.**

---

## **Who They Pick – Then and Now**

They didn’t just find you by accident.
They found you because you ticked the right boxes.

✔ Low-income background
✔ Difficult home life
✔ Looking for love, escape, validation
✔ Isolated, unheard, invisible

They look for the girls who are already slipping through the cracks.

Back then, it was council estates, MSN, texting, “older lads in cars.”
**Now it’s DMs, Snap, TikTok filters, fake accounts.**

**Same pattern. Same silence. Same trauma.**

And they’re not lurking in alleyways or wearing masks.

**They’re charming. Polished. Friendly. Normal.**

That’s the point.
**They have to seem normal—so no one questions it.**

---

## **The Online Hook – It’s a Numbers Game**

In the early days of the internet, we didn’t know.
Nobody talked about grooming.
Nobody warned us.

It was a fishing pond, and we were in it.

A message here. A compliment there.
“Where you from?”
“How old are you?”
“Show me?”

It moved fast.
And if you didn’t play? They had ten more lined up.

**Now it’s more advanced.**
Burner accounts. Fake identities. Hidden chat groups.
Still the same goal:
**Find the one who replies. The one who’s unsure. The one who won’t tell.**

It was never about who you were.
It was about who they could mould you into.

---

## **How They Test – And Get In**

They’re patient.
They’re subtle.
They learn you.

They ask questions under the surface:
Who do you live with?
Are your parents around?
Do you get on with them?

They’re building a profile.

Then come the soft pushes:
“You’re mature for your age.”
“You’re not like other girls.”
“No one else understands me like you.”

Then it escalates.
Always does.
**The line moves, inch by inch, until you don’t even remember where it started.**

---

## **How They Keep You Silent – Then and Now**

Back then, it was:
“No one would believe you.”
“Don’t tell anyone, they wouldn’t understand.”
“This is our secret.”

Now?
It’s blackmail, threats, exposure.
“I’ve got your pictures.”
“I know where your family lives.”
“I’ll ruin you.”

But honestly?
**They usually don’t even need to say much.**

Because by the time they’re done,
**you blame yourself.**

And the shame is enough to keep anyone quiet.

---

## **They’re Still Out There**

People love to think it’s “historical.”
Like this was a 2000s problem.
Like we’ve evolved since then.

We haven’t.

They’re just harder to spot now.
Smarter. More careful. More tech-literate.

But the playbook hasn’t changed.

They still seek out the vulnerable.
They still hide in plain sight.
And they’re still doing this, every single day.

To girls who are just like we were.
Who have no idea what they’re walking into.
Who think it’s just attention, validation, maybe even love.

Until it’s too late.

---

## **If You Think This Doesn't Happen Anymore – You're Not Looking Hard Enough**

This isn’t just the past.
This isn’t just our story.
This isn’t done.

**This is still happening.**
In every community. On every platform. In every corner.

**It never stopped.**
And unless people start paying attention—it never will.

---

#### Because it’s not just the predators.
**It’s the systems, the silence, the institutions that protect them.**
