## **Police Arrest Suspect After Exposure Teams Track Him Across South Wales**

**Cwmbran, South Wales –** **Peter Arnott, 32, a chef from Cwmbran,** was arrested following a **large-scale effort by multiple predator exposure teams**, culminating in a **live-streamed confrontation by Dank Dragon**. 

Arnott had been **actively sought for a week** before being **intercepted by ASPO, tracked by Graham Searcher, and ultimately passed to Dank Dragon for the sting.**

Exposure teams had already **identified Arnott as a high-risk predator**, citing concerns that **his offences may extend beyond online decoy operations.** Following his arrest, Dank Dragon **issued a public call for victims**, indicating that **his history may include real-world offences, not just online interactions.**

---

## **Found Working in a Family-Friendly Pub – Staff Initially Deny His Presence**

Arnott was **located at his workplace—the Blinkin Owl Pub, a well-known local establishment frequented by families and ch**ildren.

Upon arrival, staff initially did not confirm whether he was present. However, after speaking with management, the team was able to verify he was working that day.

To maintain public safety, the confrontation took place away from the premises.

### **The Problem of Known Predators in Public-Facing Roles**

Cases like this highlight **a disturbing pattern—offenders managing to secure employment in places where they have access to children, despite extensive evidence of their predatory behaviour.**

🔹 **Are employers failing to conduct proper background checks?**
🔹 **Do some businesses protect employees instead of prioritising public safety?**

These are **serious questions** that need addressing in the wake of Arnott’s arrest.

---

## **A Predator With a Disturbing History **

Following his arrest, **Dank Dragon issued a public call for victims**, after receiving reports that **Arnott may have a history of offending that extends beyond online decoys.**

While questioned by the team, **Arnott denied being a paedophile but openly admitted to sending indecent images to minors**—a contradiction seen in many similar cases.

When confronted about his actions, he **attempted to downplay his behaviour** by blaming substance use:

> 
> **“I don’t make mistakes when I’m not off my head like.”**
> 
> 
> 

A Dank Dragon team member immediately challenged this, asking:

> 
> **“So, you’re only abusing children when you’re drunk, then?”**
> 
> 
> 

Arnott, appearing flustered, responded:

> 
> **“No, not really, no… but it’s just…”**
> 
> 
> 

This **partial admission and evasive response** raise concerns about whether this is **part of a larger pattern.**

---

## **Family Protection and the Growing Pattern of Denial**

Before Arnott’s workplace confrontation, **exposure teams visited his home**, where **his family denied he was there.**

While they **did not refute the allegations**, their **immediate defensiveness and refusal to acknowledge his whereabouts** reflect **a wider trend in similar cases—where families shield offenders instead of holding them accountable.**

🔹 **Why do some families choose to protect predators rather than ensure justice is served?**
🔹 **Is there a culture of silence surrounding abuse in certain communities?**

These **uncomfortable but necessary questions** must be addressed as part of the wider conversation about tackling predatory behaviour.

---

## **Police Intervention & Arrest – Was Law Enforcement Too Slow?**

As the confrontation unfolded, **South Wales Police arrived on the scene.**

Dank Dragon's Team **immediately handed over extensive evidence**, including:

- **Chat logs detailing his predatory behaviour.**

- **Indecent images he sent to minors.**

- **A full profile tracking his online activity and suspected history.**

🔹 **The Team debriefed the officers and they conducted an arrest.**
🔹 **Arnott’s belongings were confiscated, and he was placed into a police van.**

Police have **not yet made a public statement** regarding the charges Arnott may face.

### **The Question of Law Enforcement Response Times**

Arnott had already been **flagged by multiple exposure teams** before being located.

🔹 **Would law enforcement have acted as quickly without exposure teams intervening?**
🔹 **How many predators continue offending simply because they haven’t yet been ‘caught’?**

The reality is that **many cases slip through the cracks, leaving children vulnerable.** Exposure teams argue that **without their work, many of these predators would never be caught.**

---

## **What Happens Next?**

With **police now handling the case**, potential developments could include:

- **Formal charges** related to sending indecent images to a minor.

- **Further investigation** into past behaviours, particularly given reports of non-decoy victims.

The wider question remains: **Will this case prompt stricter measures to prevent predators from accessing public spaces where children are present?**
