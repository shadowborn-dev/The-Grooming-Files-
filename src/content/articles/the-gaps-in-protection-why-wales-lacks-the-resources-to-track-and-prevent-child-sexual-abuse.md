### **The Problem No One Talks About**

In Wales, child sexual abuse (CSA) remains a **deeply underreported and under-resourced issue** within the justice system. While exposure teams and advocacy groups work tirelessly to **bring offenders to light**, the **lack of a centralised, accessible database** of cases and offenders **leaves parents, communities, and authorities struggling to grasp the full scale of the problem.**

Unlike other crime categories, CSA records are often **hidden behind bureaucracy, inaccessible to the public, and poorly maintained** in terms of real-time updates. In a digital age where offenders **exploit technology to prey on children**, why is there **no comprehensive system in place** to track and prevent these crimes?

---

## **The Lack of Publicly Accessible Data**

One of the biggest challenges in tackling CSA in Wales is **the absence of an open database** where the public can access vital information about offenders, trends, and conviction rates.

🔹 **No public offender map** – Unlike some countries where **sex offender registries** are partially accessible, Wales has **no public access to data about convicted predators.**

🔹 **No central database of CSA-related arrests or cases** – The public is forced to **rely on sporadic media reports or exposure teams** to hear about recent cases.

🔹 **Sarah’s Law has limitations** – The Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme (**Sarah’s Law**) allows **limited access to information**, but only under **strict conditions** and does not provide **full transparency.**

Without an accessible system, **parents, schools, and communities** are left unaware of potential risks in their own areas.

---

## **The Police and Legal System’s Failures**

Despite thousands of CSA-related crimes being recorded each year, **there is no single authority responsible for tracking and reporting these cases in Wales.**

📌 **Rising CSA Image Crimes** – Police in England and Wales are now recording **over 100 child sexual abuse image crimes every day**, with **38,685 incidents reported in the past year.** ([NSPCC](https://www.nspcc.org.uk))

📌 **Registered Sex Offenders** – As of March 2024, there were **70,052 registered sex offenders** in England and Wales—**a 3% increase from the previous year.** ([Yahoo News UK](https://uk.news.yahoo.com))

📌 **Teenage Offenders** – Over **half of CSA cases in the UK involve teenagers**, with **14 being the most common age of reported offenders.** ([ITV News](https://www.itv.com/news))

**The real question remains: How many offenders are slipping through the cracks? How many children are unprotected due to the lack of open data sharing by law enforcement?**

---

## **Why Are Exposure Teams Filling the Gap?**

The **failures of law enforcement and lack of accessible databases** have led to the rise of **independent exposure teams.** These groups **fill the gaps**, tracking online predators, exposing offenders, and pushing for accountability.

🚨 **Proactive Investigations** – **Exposure Teams** often **catch predators before police even begin investigations.**

🚨 **Public Awareness** – Exposure teams **share case updates publicly**, ensuring that communities **know about local offenders before they can reoffend.**

🚨 **Forcing Action** – Without these teams, **many predators would go unchecked**, as **police often delay action until overwhelming public pressure forces their hand.**

However, **exposure teams are not a replacement for a functioning justice system.** The fact that **volunteer groups are doing this work** should be a **wake-up call** to how broken the system is.

---

## **What Needs to Change?**

To **properly combat CSA**, Wales must implement **urgent reforms**:

✔ **A centralised, publicly accessible CSA case database** – Wales needs **real-time data** on investigations, arrests, and convictions to **track trends and prevent repeat offending.**

✔ **Stronger digital tracking of online predators** – Many grooming cases happen **entirely online**, yet **police cybercrime resources remain limited.**

✔ **More transparency in police data sharing** – **Parents and communities deserve access to critical safety information** rather than relying on exposure teams.

✔ **Better resources for CSA survivors** – Many survivors in Wales **struggle to access legal support, mental health care, and protection from their abusers.**

## **The Cost of Silence**

Wales has **a serious and urgent problem** when it comes to **CSA tracking and offender accountability.** While exposure teams continue to **fill the gaps**, the reality is **this should not be their job.**

**Until law enforcement and government agencies prioritise full transparency, create an accessible offender database, and improve CSA case tracking, children in Wales will remain at risk.**

**Silence allows predators to operate unchecked. It’s time to demand change.**
