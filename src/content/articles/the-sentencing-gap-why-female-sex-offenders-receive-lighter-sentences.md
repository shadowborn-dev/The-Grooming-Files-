*Part 4 of 5: The Female Predators Series*

---

Catherine Pearl: 2 years 4 months.

Rebecca Joynes: 6.5 years.

Both teachers. Both convicted child sex offenders. Both abused positions of trust.

**But there's a gap.**

Not just between these two cases.

**Between how we sentence female offenders and how we sentence male offenders for comparable crimes.**

This isn't about whether sentences are too harsh or too lenient.

**It's about whether they're equal.**

Because when the justice system treats identical behaviour differently based on perpetrator gender, it sends a message:

**Female perpetrated child sexual abuse is less serious.**

**And that message costs children their safety.**

---

## THE TWO SENTENCES: WHAT THE COURTS SAID

### **Catherine Pearl: 2 Years 4 Months**

**Convicted of:**

- Two counts of sexual activity with a girl as an adult abusing a position of trust

**Offending period:**

- "A period of years"

**Impact:**

- "Terrible impact" on victim (Court of Appeal judgement, July 2025)

**Sentencing judge's view:**

- Judge Emma Nott "was plainly right in our opinion to take a very serious view of it" (Court of Appeal)

**Initial sentence:** 2 years 4 months imprisonment

**Sexual Harm Prevention Order:** 10 years (parts later modified on appeal as "unnecessary and disproportionate")

**Sentenced:** 24 January 2025, Oxford Crown Court

---

### **Rebecca Joynes: 6.5 Years**

**Convicted of:**

- Four counts of sexual activity with a child

- Two counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust

**Offending:**

- Two victims, both 15 years old

- First victim: overnight stay, sexual intercourse, £345 gift

- Second victim: targeted whilst on bail for first offences

- Relationship continued, Joynes became pregnant

**Sentence:** 6.5 years imprisonment

**Additional orders:**

- Registered sex offender for life

- Sexual Harm Prevention Order for 10 years

- Restraining orders for both victims

**Sentenced:** 4 July 2024, Manchester Crown Court

---

## THE OBSERVABLE GAP

**Pearl:**

- Deputy head teacher (higher position of authority)

- Abuse over "years" (longer duration)

- Single victim

- On school premises (institutional setting)

- **Sentence: 2 years 4 months**

**Joynes:**

- Teacher

- Two victims

- Continued offending while on bail

- **Sentence: 6.5 years**

**The difference: 4 years 2 months**

---

## WHAT EXPLAINS THE GAP?

### **Factual Distinctions:**

**Number of victims:**

- Pearl: 1

- Joynes: 2

**Continuing to offend while on bail:**

- Pearl: Not applicable

- Joynes: Yes (targeted Boy B whilst on bail for offences against Boy A)

**Pregnancy:**

- Pearl: No

- Joynes: Yes (became pregnant by Boy B)

These factual differences provide *some* explanation for the sentencing gap between Pearl and Joynes.

**But they don't explain the broader pattern.**

---

## THE BROADER PATTERN: FEMALE VS MALE OFFENDERS

**Methodological limitation:**

As noted in Part 2, direct statistical comparison of sentences between male and female teachers convicted of similar offences requires systematic case by case analysis beyond the scope of this article series.

**However, preliminary observations raise questions:**

When reviewing reported cases of male teachers convicted of sexual offences against students, sentences frequently exceed those given to female offenders even where:

- Number of victims is comparable

- Duration of abuse is comparable

- Abuse of position of trust is present

- Victim age is comparable

**This warrants systematic investigation.**

---

## WHAT SENTENCING LANGUAGE REVEALS

Court language provides insight into how judges perceive female vs male offenders.

### **Language of Mitigation in Female Offender Cases:**

Common themes in sentencing remarks for female offenders:

- "Out of character"

- "Otherwise unblemished career"

- "Fell into a relationship"

- "Emotional vulnerability"

- "Isolation led to poor judgment"

**This language frames offending as aberration rather than predation.**

---

### **Language of Aggravation in Male Offender Cases:**

Common themes in sentencing remarks for male offenders:

- "Grooming"

- "Predatory"

- "Calculated"

- "Breach of trust"

- "Ongoing psychological harm"

**This language frames offending as deliberate predation.**

---

### **The Problem:**

**The behaviours are often identical:**

- Both groom victims

- Both abuse positions of trust

- Both cause psychological harm

- Both engage in calculated boundary violations

**But the framing differs.**

**And framing affects sentencing.**

---

## THE PROTECTIVE FRAMING IN SENTENCING

### **How It Operates:**

**1. Character evidence carries more weight for female defendants**

When a female teacher has an "unblemished career," this is treated as significant mitigation.

When a male teacher has an "unblemished career," this is treated as evidence of concealment: "He maintained a respectable front while abusing children."

**Same fact. Different interpretation.**

---

**2. Victimisation narratives**

Female offenders are more frequently permitted to present themselves as victims:

- Of isolation

- Of mental health struggles

- Of the victim's "pursuit"

- Of circumstances

Male offenders presenting similar narratives are typically rejected: "You are the adult. You held the power. You are responsible."

**Same defence. Different reception.**

---

**3. The "relationship" framing**

Female offenders' abuse is more frequently described as a "relationship" that "developed" or they "fell into."

Male offenders' abuse is described as predation, grooming, exploitation.

**Language matters.**

When abuse is framed as a relationship, it:

- Implies mutuality

- Suggests the victim had agency

- Minimises the power differential

- Reduces perceived culpability

---

## THE PEARL APPEAL: A CASE STUDY

In July 2025, Catherine Pearl appealed parts of her Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

**The Court of Appeal found:**

Certain restrictions in the original SHPO were "unnecessary and disproportionate."

Specifically, restrictions on internet capable devices and contact with children were replaced with a narrower prohibition: Pearl is banned from seeking or holding any position of authority or care of children until January 2035.

**What this reveals:**

Even after conviction for sexually abusing a child in her care over years, the legal system calibrated her restrictions to be less intrusive.

**The question:**

Would a male deputy head convicted of sexually abusing a student over years receive the same consideration?

Or would the restrictions be upheld as entirely proportionate given the offending?

---

## PREGNANCY AS AN AGGRAVATING FACTOR

Rebecca Joynes became pregnant by Boy B.

**This should be an aggravating factor:**

- Evidence of ongoing sexual contact

- Physical evidence of the abuse

- Additional trauma for the victim (his child exists as permanent evidence of his victimisation)

- Demonstrates complete disregard for consequences

**But pregnancy can also invoke sympathy:**

"She's going to be a mother"
"The child is innocent"
"Custody will be harder for her"

**The protective framing operates even here.**

Pregnancy by a victim should aggravate sentencing.

In some cases, it appears to mitigate it.

---

## THE BAIL OFFENDING AGGRAVATION

Joynes's offending while on bail for the first set of offences is a clear aggravating factor.

**It demonstrates:**

- Continued predatory behaviour despite arrest

- Disregard for legal process

- Inability to control behaviour

- High risk of reoffending

**This appropriately contributed to her 6.5 year sentence.**

**But the question remains:**

Would a male teacher who continued offending while on bail for child sexual abuse receive only 6.5 years?

Or would that bail breach be treated as evidence of dangerous persistent predation warranting significantly longer custody?

---

## WHAT SENTENCING DATA SHOULD SHOW

**If sentencing is gender neutral, we should see:**

- Comparable sentences for comparable offending

- Similar weight given to aggravating factors

- Similar weight given to mitigating factors

- Similar language in sentencing remarks

**If sentencing reflects protective framing, we see:**

- Lower sentences for female offenders

- Greater weight to mitigation for female offenders

- Different language framing female offending as aberration

- Different language framing male offending as predation

**Preliminary review suggests the latter.**

**But this requires rigorous empirical analysis.**

---

## THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES PROBLEM

**UK sentencing guidelines for sexual offences are gender neutral in text.**

**They focus on:**

- Harm to victim

- Culpability of offender

- Aggravating factors

- Mitigating factors

**But guidelines are applied by humans.**

**And humans carry protective framing.**

---

### **How Protective Framing Infiltrates Sentencing:**

**At the harm assessment stage:**

Courts may perceive male victims as less harmed:

- "He's not traumatised the way a girl would be"

- "Boys are more resilient"

- "It's different for boys"

**At the culpability assessment stage:**

Courts may perceive female offenders as less culpable:

- "She fell into this"

- "She was vulnerable herself"

- "This is out of character"

**At the aggravation assessment stage:**

Courts may weigh aggravating factors differently:

- Abuse of trust treated as less serious when perpetrator is female

- Grooming behaviours framed as "developing relationship"

- Power differential minimised

**At the mitigation assessment stage:**

Courts may give more weight to mitigation for female offenders:

- Mental health

- Isolation

- Previous good character

- Impact of custody on children

---

## THE INSTITUTIONAL SENTENCING PROBLEM

Pearl was deputy head teacher.

**This should aggravate her sentence:**

- Higher position of authority

- Greater breach of trust

- Specific safeguarding responsibilities

- Institutional power to conceal abuse

**But it may have operated differently:**

Her senior position, professional reputation, and "unblemished career" may have been treated as mitigating factors:

"She's thrown away a distinguished career"
"She held a position of respect"
"This is so out of character for someone of her standing"

**The same institutional authority that facilitated her abuse becomes evidence of how much she has to lose.**

**This is protective framing in judicial reasoning.**

---

## WHAT THE VICTIMS EXPERIENCE

### **When Sentences Are Lower:**

For victims of female perpetrators who receive lighter sentences than comparable male offenders:

**The message received is:**

- "What happened to you was less serious"

- "Your abuser is less dangerous"

- "The system doesn't view this the same way"

**This affects:**

- Willingness to report

- Participation in prosecution

- Recovery process

- Trust in justice system

---

### **When Abuse Is Reframed:**

When courts describe abuse as a "relationship" or suggest the victim "pursued" the adult:

**The message is:**

- "You had agency in this"

- "This wasn't really abuse"

- "You're partly responsible"

**For child victims, this is revictimisation.**

---

## THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION PROBLEM

**Sentencing shapes public understanding of harm.**

**When we see:**

- Male teacher: 12+ years for sexual abuse of student

- Female teacher: 2-6 years for sexual abuse of student

**The public learns:**

- Female perpetrated abuse is less serious

- Male victims are harmed less

- Women who abuse children deserve more sympathy

**This reinforces:**

- Underreporting by male victims

- Protective framing in institutions

- Lighter sentences in future cases

**It's a self-reinforcing cycle.**

---

## THE RESEARCH QUESTION

**What we need:**

Systematic analysis of sentencing in child sexual abuse cases comparing:

- Male vs female perpetrators

- Controlling for:

- Number of victims

- Age of victims

- Duration of abuse

- Aggravating factors

- Mitigating factors

- Guilty plea vs trial

**This would reveal:**

- Whether a sentencing gap exists

- How large it is

- What factors explain it

- Whether it's justified by case differences or reflects bias

**Until we have this data, we're working from:**

- Individual case observations

- Anecdotal patterns

- Preliminary reviews

**But the pattern is visible enough to warrant investigation.**

---

## WHAT EQUAL SENTENCING WOULD LOOK LIKE

**Equal sentencing doesn't mean:**

- Identical sentences for all offenders

- Ignoring individual case factors

- Mechanical application of guidelines

**It means:**

- Comparable weight to comparable aggravating factors

- Comparable weight to comparable mitigating factors

- Gender neutral language in sentencing remarks

- Focus on harm to victim, not gender of perpetrator

- Recognition that all child sexual abuse is serious

---

## THE CATHERINE PEARL QUESTION

**2 years 4 months for:**

- Deputy head teacher

- Sexual abuse of student in her care

- Abuse over "years"

- Committed in school setting

- Terrible impact on victim

**Is this sentence proportionate to the harm?**

**Or does it reflect protective framing?**

The Court of Appeal confirmed the sentencing judge "was plainly right to take a very serious view" of the offending.

**But 2 years 4 months for years of abuse by a deputy head teacher with safeguarding responsibilities?**

**The question stands.**

---

## THE REBECCA JOYNES QUESTION

**6.5 years for:**

- Teacher

- Two 15 year old victims

- Sexual intercourse with both

- £345 gift (material grooming)

- Overnight stay at her flat

- Continued offending while on bail

- Became pregnant by second victim

**Is this sentence proportionate to the harm?**

**Or does it also reflect protective framing?**

Because while 6.5 years is significantly more than Pearl's sentence, the question remains:

**Would a male teacher who:**

- Sexually abused two 15 year old students

- Bought them expensive gifts

- Took them to his flat

- Got one pregnant

- Continued offending while on bail

**…receive only 6.5 years?**

---

## WHAT COMES NEXT

In **Part 5**, we'll examine prevention: what Catherine Pearl and Rebecca Joynes teach us about recognition, response, and building safeguarding frameworks that protect all children regardless of perpetrator gender.

We'll address:

- Warning signs we missed

- Institutional failures

- How to break the cycle of invisibility

- What gender neutral safeguarding actually looks like

- How to support victims regardless of perpetrator gender

**The sentencing gap isn't just about fairness to defendants.**

**It's about protection for potential victims.**

**Because when sentences are lower, the message is clear:**

**This abuse is less serious.**

**And predators hear that message too.**
