How many times can you feel the floor give way beneath you before you stop trusting it completely?

**Adam John**, from Pontypridd, was sentenced last year to more than seven years in prison for multiple child sex offences—including the rape of a child.

And I went to school with him.

I wasn't friends with him. We never hung out. But the second I saw his name, I recognised him instantly. That face from the corridors. The schoolyard. Another one from those blurry childhood years now revealed for who he really is. Another person whose past crossed paths with mine—however briefly—and is now behind bars for destroying the innocence of others.

When I wrote *[**“I Knew Him: Now He’s a Convicted Predator,”**](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/2025/03/19/i-knew-him-now-hes-a-convicted-predator/)* I didn’t think I’d be following it up this soon. But here I am. Another article. Another gut-punch. Another reminder that predators aren’t rare—they’re everywhere. They blend into your memories until the mask slips.

**What Happened**

In May 2024, **Adam John**, 31, from Pontypridd, was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court to **seven years and three months in prison** after pleading guilty to multiple child sex offences:

- **Three counts of sexual assault of a child**

- **One count of rape**

He was also made subject to:

- A **Sexual Harm Prevention Order**

- **Indefinite restraining orders**

These orders are designed to protect his victims and the public from future harm—but as always, they come far too late for the lives already traumatised.

---

**What the Police Said**

Following the sentencing, **Police Constable Chris Phillips** stated:

> 
> *“I would like to commend the incredible bravery of the victims in reporting this attack, which has allowed us to bring a dangerous individual to justice. I hope that this sentence will serve as encouragement to other victims of sexual abuse to come forward. We will believe you and do everything we can to bring offenders to justice, no matter how long ago the offences took place.”*
> 
> 
> 

It’s a comforting statement. But for many survivors, it doesn’t reflect their experience.

Because more often than not, victims aren’t believed. They’re doubted, dismissed, retraumatised—or dragged through a system that questions them more than the predator. The bravery it takes to speak out is already massive. But the fight that comes after the disclosure? That’s what breaks so many.

That’s why stories like this matter. That’s why I’ll keep writing them—until the reality starts to match the promises.

**Why This Matters**

I’m not writing this because I have any connection to Adam other than a long-past school memory. I’m writing this because *this is happening everywhere*, and far too often, it’s happening silently—right next to us. These aren’t strangers in alleyways. These are classmates. Co-workers. Old neighbours. People from your past.

**People like Adam John.**

To the victims: you are unbelievably strong. You didn’t just survive—you made sure this man faced consequences.
To others still holding in your stories: you matter. You are not alone.
To those reading this and feeling that familiar shock of recognition: I see you. I know how that feels.

We need to keep saying their names. We need to keep writing these stories.

Because these aren’t just headlines.
They’re lives.
They’re truths.
And they deserve to be told.

They look like people we *knew*. And that’s exactly why we have to keep speaking. Because every time we break the silence, we take some of their power back.”*

If any part of this story resonated with you—if you recognised someone, felt something stir, or have your *own* story that’s never been told—please know you’re not alone.

🔞 **I’m currently collecting stories from adults (18+ only)** who experienced **online or offline grooming** in the early days of the internet. This is part of a wider survivor-led project to expose the realities we were never warned about.

Let’s keep breaking the silence—together.
