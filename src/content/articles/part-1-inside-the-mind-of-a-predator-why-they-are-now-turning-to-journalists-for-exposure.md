*"Predators Are Slipping Through the Cracks — And They Are Coming to Me to Be Exposed."*
*A survivor-led investigative series documenting a new phase of systemic failure — when predators beg to be stopped, and the system does nothing.*

## ***"I want to be exposed."***

It was a message I never expected to receive once — let alone twice.

Months ago, a UK predator approached me voluntarily — asking to be exposed. That became *Three Days with a Predator* — a series that shook me to my core.

Now it has happened again.

An Australian offender — not under pressure, not being pursued — came to me unprompted. A second predator. A second warning sign.

*"I am a danger to children,"* he told me.
*"I would have sex with them. I do it rough."*

This is not a coincidence. It is becoming a pattern.

And it exposes a terrifying reality: predators who know they are spiralling, who know they will offend again, are now turning to journalists and exposure groups — because they know the system won’t stop them.

---

## A System in Freefall

I want to be clear: this is not vigilante work. This is not entertainment. This is public interest journalism — and what is happening here should alarm us all.

When predators feel safer confessing to an independent journalist than facing the justice system, we have a problem.

When those same predators openly state they will offend again unless physically stopped, we have a crisis.

This is now the second time an offender has sought me out to expose himself. Two cases, two countries, one undeniable pattern: offenders are spiralling, and the system is failing to catch them.

## The Contact

*"I want to be exposed."*

The message landed in my inbox without warning.

I hadn’t approached him. He wasn’t caught by a sting. He wasn’t facing new charges.

He came to me — because he knew he was dangerous, and he knew no one else was going to stop him.

*"I am a danger to children,"* he said.
*"Only jail, constant monitoring and public shaming would stop me."*

Convicted in 2020 for four counts of using a carriage service to harass minors, he had received an 18-month suspended sentence and community service — a sentence he now described with contempt.

*"The system’s too soft,"* he said.
*"People like me should be locked up for good, tracked 24/7, and publicly shamed so everyone knows who we are."*

He wasn’t saying this out of guilt. He was saying it because he was spiralling — and he knew it.

---

## The Escalation Pattern

As I questioned him, a disturbing layer emerged:

He wasn’t just contacting me. He had already approached multiple exposure groups, begging them to expose him.

*"I want to be exposed,"* he told them too.

This was not a random impulse. It was an escalating behaviour — a predator aware he could no longer control his urges.

Professionals recognise this as an **escalation cycle**:

- Guilt builds → compulsion builds → fantasy intensifies

- The offender knows they are losing control

- They seek external punishment or boundaries — because their internal boundaries are broken

And when they do, the system has no effective response.

If they breach court orders, action may be triggered. But if they spiral publicly — contacting journalists, exposure groups, or the public — there is no guaranteed intervention.

I saw this with Chris. I am seeing it again now.

And the predators themselves know it.

*"Society doesn’t get how dangerous I am,"* he told me.
*"They underestimate the risk."*

## Inside the Mind of a Predator

What follows is a glimpse into the mind of a predator who knows exactly what he is, feels no hope of change — and sees no reason to stop unless forced.

His own words tell the story better than anything I could write:

*"I don’t even bother with excuses anymore,"* he said.
*"I know my actions are disgusting and wrong — preying on kids who can’t fight back."*

*"Kids can’t consent, full stop,"* he said.

Yet despite this clarity, the compulsion remains:

*"I only feel bad because I got caught, not because I actually care,"* he admitted.
*"That’s how low I’ve sunk."*

When asked whether he would stop if a child said no or showed fear:

*"I’d probably keep going — just easing up a bit."*

*"Only jail, constant monitoring and public shaming would stop me,"* he repeated.

His view of his victims is equally chilling:

*"Most of my victims are just objects in my twisted headspace,"* he said.

*"I fantasise about them daily."*
*"I panic when I see police warnings — but I keep going."*

And he knows he is not alone:

*"Heaps of us are still out there,"* he told me.
*"Hiding."*

## System Failure — and Public Risk Now

There is no question: this man is an active danger to children.

He knows it. I know it. Now — so do the police.

Following his escalating admissions, I formally reported the full material to both UK Police and Australian Federal Police.

I did not do this lightly. I did it because the risk is immediate and real.

This is not a man reflecting on historic crimes. This is a man actively seeking out child content, fantasising daily, and openly contacting exposure groups in a desperate bid to force the system to intervene.

And so far — no action has been taken.

When predators are left **begging to be stopped** and still walking free, that is a system in deep crisis.

This is now the second time this has happened to me as a journalist — and I fear it will not be the last.

I will continue this series because the public needs to understand what is happening — and the system needs to be held accountable for its failure to act.

*"Heaps of us are still out there,"* this man said.
*"Hiding."*

The real question is — why are we still letting them?

**Editorial Note:**

Following receipt of these confessions, I formally referred the case to both UK Police and Australian Federal Police (Child Protection Operations) for urgent safeguarding review.

This series is being published in the public interest to expose critical systemic failures and to inform and protect the public.
