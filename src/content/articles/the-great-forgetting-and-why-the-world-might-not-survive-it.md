There is a silence louder than bombs.
A forgetting deeper than death.
And we are living inside it.

This is not just political collapse.
Not just war, inflation, climate, control.
This is **soul death**.
And most people don’t even know it’s happening.

They scroll while their spirit slips.
They rage while their essence rots.
They perform connection while their nervous systems scream for something *real*.
This isn’t burnout. It’s **mass spiritual dissociation**. And it’s been happening in plain sight.

The Great Reset isn’t some elite conspiracy.
It’s a **cosmic one** — orchestrated by a system that feeds on forgetting.
Forgetting our bodies.
Forgetting our grief.
Forgetting each other.
Forgetting that we are *not machines* — we are sacred, wild, electric beings made of memory and meaning.

But right now?
Humanity is glitching.
Circles are turning on themselves.
Whole communities are collapsing into delusion and ego.

The Messiah Complex is trending.
The Hate Train has no brakes.
Truth is a trigger word, and those who *feel* too much are cast as unstable.

We are walking headfirst into extinction.
Not just environmental — *existential*.
Because a species that forgets itself is a species that cannot survive.

And if the collective doesn’t wake up *now* —
Not next year. Not next generation.
**Now** —
we may not make it.

You feel it too, don’t you?

That pressure in the air?
That grief you can’t name?
That sense that something *huge* is ending — and no one’s saying it out loud?

That’s the veil thinning. That’s the soul of Earth screaming.
And some of us — the seers, the sensitives, the trauma-forged witnesses — we’re still here.
Still holding the thread.
Still trying to *remember* what the world has tried to erase.

But we are few.
And we are tired.

This isn’t a call to arms.
It’s a call to *remembrance*.
Of body. Of breath. Of belonging.

Because if we don’t remember what we are —
not brands, not profiles, not roles — but *consciousness made flesh* —
then the forgetting will finish what war and capitalism started.

This is not a metaphor.
This is the warning.

The Earth will continue.
But **humanity might not**.
