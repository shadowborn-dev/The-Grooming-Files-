## ***The Porn Crisis***

### Th*e system isn’t broken — it’s working exactly as designed.*

---

Let’s get something straight:
**Most people don’t find extreme porn because they search for it.**
They find it because it’s *recommended.*

One click.
Then autoplay.
Then “related videos.”
Then it’s darker. Louder. More taboo.

Not by accident, by design.

---

## The algorithm grooms for escalation.

> 
> Ribeiro et al. (2020): Found that major porn platforms recommend increasingly violent, aggressive, and taboo content — including incest, coercion, and pseudo-underage categories — within minutes of basic searches.
> 
> 
> 

You click “teen”?
You’re shown “barely legal,” “schoolgirl,” “dad/daughter,” “non-consensual.”

The system doesn’t care about legality.
It cares about engagement.

And nothing gets engagement like taboo.

---

## This isn’t edgy. It’s strategic.

- The more extreme the content, the longer users stay

- The longer they stay, the more ads they see

- The more ads they see, the more profit is made

**Violence = revenue.**
**Degradation = data.**

What does that teach a 12-year-old?
A 14-year-old?
A 20-year-old who’s never had real intimacy?

That sex is dominance.
That submission is sexy.
That consent is a glitch, not a rule.

---

## Studies back this up — and the industry knows it.

> 
> Hussy et al. (2018): Found that mainstream porn sites feature categories mimicking child abuse, incest, coercion, and unconscious women, normalising themes of exploitation.
> 
> 
> 

> 
> Bravehearts (2024): Found that 85% of violent porn is accessible to minors without age verification, and 63% of teens report seeing content they described as “non-consensual.”

## And this is what most kids see *before* they ever learn about sex.

Not just what sex looks like, but what *pleasure* looks like.

And if pleasure looks like silence, pain, choking, and domination?
What happens when they try to act it out?

We’re not just watching a porn crisis.
We’re watching a generation being groomed by autoplay.

---

## Porn doesn’t need a predator.

The system *is* the predator.

- It doesn’t ask your age.

- It doesn’t check your trauma.

- It doesn’t care what you’re ready for.

- It just shows you what keeps you there.

And for too many, that’s what breaks them.
