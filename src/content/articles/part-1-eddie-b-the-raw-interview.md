## Predator under CPS investigation! 

**Sophie:** Can I send you some questions about you please?
**Eddie:** Sure.

---

**Q1. Why did you reach out to me — what made you pick me?**
**Eddie:** I watched one of the videos on your site, picked you because you want to expose what’s going on.

**Q2. What are the exact allegations you’re facing with CPS right now?**
**Eddie:** Allegations are receiving inappropriate images of children, and sending inappropriate images of children. Upskirting.

**Q3. Have you ever offended against a child — yes or no?**
**Eddie:** 3 no.

**Q4. Do you believe you’re a danger to children right now?**
**Eddie:** 4 no.

**Q5. Would you offend again if nobody stopped you?**
**Eddie:** 5 no.

**Q6. You said you’ve watched exposure videos — what do they do for you?**
**Eddie:** Do nothing for me really, just watched for curiosity reasons.

**Q7. What does “being exposed” mean to you personally?**
**Eddie:** These sites and the people running these sites need to be exposed, it’s just getting out of control.

---

**Q8. Is exposure a punishment for you, or is it something you secretly want?**
**Eddie:** No it’s not punishment for me. What punishment? For these sites online and the people running them — they need punishment.

**Q9. What happens in your head before you reach out for “exposure”?**
**Eddie:** My head is telling me to expose the people who need exposing.

**Q10. After you confess or get exposed, do you feel relief… or arousal?**
**Eddie:** If I get exposed, allegations at the moment, but will be relieved when it’s over.

**Q11. How long does that feeling last before the urges come back?**
**Eddie:** Feeling can come back sometimes when I see schoolgirls.

**Q12. What’s the darkest thought you’ve ever had that you’ve never told anyone?**

**Eddie:** Yes course we can be stopped, as you can see am under investigation.

**Q14. What kind of help or intervention would actually stop you?**
**Eddie:** Nothing.

**Q15. What do you want people to know about you when this is published?**
**Eddie:** That I have helped in exposing people.

**Q16. You say you’re not a danger — so why do you admit urges come back when you see schoolgirls?**
**Eddie:** I am not attracted to children, there just thoughts I get. I would never act on it.

**Q17. You say you’re “helping expose people” — who exactly do you mean?**
**Eddie:** These people who prey on children online, it’s disgusting.

**Q18. If you’ve “done nothing,” why are there multiple allegations against you?**
**Eddie:** Can’t answer that.

**Q19. Why did you admit your darkest thought so openly? Did you want someone to finally know?**
**Eddie:** It’s just fantasy. I can get aroused seeing 18 year old in uniform.

**Q20. Do you understand that admitting these fantasies is proof you’re a danger?**
**Eddie:** Am not a danger to anyone. I will never act on it. It’s fantasy.

**Q2. Do you think about children every day, or only in certain situations?**
**Eddie:** Certain situations, which is not often.

**Q3. What is it about school uniforms that excites you?**
**Eddie:** It’s the short skirts with no leggings or stockings, which some skirts are too short.

**Q4. Do you see children as “sexual beings,” or do you know it’s wrong while still wanting it?**

**Q8. Would you rather go to prison, or be exposed publicly?**
**Eddie:** They should get exposed, that’s why am helping you.

**Q9. Do you ever imagine being humiliated for what you’ve done? Does that turn you on?**
**Eddie:** I have visited a dominatrix to be punished. And punished I got for having nawty feelings and wearing panties.

**Q10. Why reach out to someone who exposes predators, if you truly didn’t want exposure?**
**Eddie:** To expose the ones who need exposing.

---

**Eddie:** Can’t explain it. I just get aroused seeing girls in uniform.

**Eddie:** No.

---

**Eddie:** Probably not.

**Q22. Have you ever spoken to children online or in person in a sexual way?**
**Eddie:** Never.

**Q23. What’s the difference, in your mind, between thinking about children and acting on it?**
**Eddie:** I’m not going to act on it with a child. Adult yes.

---

**Q (Follow-up): You told me you get aroused seeing schoolgirls in uniform. If you’re not a danger, why do those feelings come back again and again?**
**Eddie:** I can’t explain it. I just seem to get aroused, but I don’t masturbate to them.

**Q: Do you accept that your fantasies make you a predator, even if you say you’d “never act” on them?**
**Eddie:** No, because I don’t masturbate to them.

---

**Eddie (unsolicited):** Can I ask you a question?
**Sophie:** Go ahead.
**Eddie:** What made you expose people?
**Sophie:** People just started coming to me, asking to be exposed. I started an online movement for people who were groomed online in the early 2000s.
**Eddie:** That was awful, that grooming in 2000s Rochdale was terrible.
