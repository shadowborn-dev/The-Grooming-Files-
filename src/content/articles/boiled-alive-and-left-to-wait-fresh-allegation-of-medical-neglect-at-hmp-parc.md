More serious allegations have emerged from inside **HMP Parc**, where a prisoner is reported to have been the victim of a **boiling water attack involving sugar** and then allegedly denied urgent hospital care.

Sources with direct contact inside the prison say the man sustained **burns to his stomach** after **boiling water mixed with sugar** was thrown at him. Known behind bars as “**jugging**,” this type of attack is designed to cause **maximum pain and permanent injury**.

One family member posted publicly:
*“My brother in there said on the phone it was boiling water with sugar. Been kicking off all week apparently.”*

## “A plaster? For burns like that?”

Several contributors have come forward on HMP Prisons Justice Group, stating the injured prisoner was **not transferred to hospital**, and was instead given **a plaster and paracetamol**. The outrage was immediate.

> 
> *“A ****f**************ing plaster over a burn mind! Are they that **f***ing* dull?”*
> *“FFS, you put cling film over a burn to prevent infection and get them to A&E. Not 24 hours later.”*
> *“Seriously, they need hospital treatment immediately.”*
>

At the time of writing, **HMP Parc has not confirmed or denied the incident**. The specific wing has not been officially identified, though early sources had linked it to **B Wing**, and family reports suggest **multiple violent incidents** have taken place there in recent days.

## Burns that stick and failures that spread

So-called “jugging” attacks using boiling water and sugar are intended to **stick to the skin**, causing severe burns, deep tissue damage, and a high risk of **infection**.

Medical professionals typically consider such injuries to require **immediate hospital care**, not just prison-based first aid. Delay in treatment can lead to long-term complications, including permanent scarring and sepsis.

If this prisoner was indeed left untreated for up to 24 hours, as claimed, it raises serious concerns about **medical negligence**, **duty of care**, and **systemic desensitisation to harm** inside Parc.

## A prison already in crisis

This incident adds to the growing list of allegations against HMP Parc, which is managed by private firm **G4S**. The facility has come under increasing scrutiny over the past year following a spike in **prisoner deaths**, serious **safeguarding breaches**, and repeated accusations of **healthcare failures**.

Whistleblowers, campaigners, and grieving families have been calling for **an urgent independent investigation** into the prison’s management and internal oversight.

## When the law is ignored

Every person in custody, regardless of their crime. Is entitled to **basic medical care** and **protection from inhumane treatment** under UK law.

A delay in treating severe burns could amount to a violation of **Article 3 of the Human Rights Act**, which protects individuals from torture or degrading treatment. It may also breach the **Prison Rules 1999**, the **Health and Safety at Work Act**, and the Ministry of Justice’s own standards of prisoner care.

We are actively seeking official comment from **G4S**, **HMP Parc**, and the **Ministry of Justice**.

This article will be updated if new information comes to light.
