### **Residents Demand Relocation Over Safety Concerns**

**Cwmbran, South Wales**. 

A community-led protest is set to take place on **Monday, 17th March at 6 PM** in **Croesyceiliog (Bronllys Place, NP44 2DW)** to demand the immediate removal of a convicted sex offender who has been housed near schools and, most concerningly, close to his victim.

Outraged residents argue that the local housing association, **Bron Afon**, has failed to prioritise child safety by allowing a **convicted child abuser** to live in a **residential area filled with vulnerable children and within proximity of the victim.**

---

### **The Outrage: Why the Protest is Happening**

The protest was sparked after **Matthew Thomas**, convicted in 2024 of **two counts of assault by touching a child under 13** and **one count of exposure**, was placed in a **residential area close to multiple schools and nurseries**. Despite **public outcry**, he was **not given a prison sentence** but was instead placed on the **sex offenders register for five years**.

Campaigners argue that **this decision has failed to protect the community** and has **forced the victim to live in fear.**

A protest organiser stated:
*"We are demanding that this predator is removed from the area immediately. No child should have to live in fear because the system works against them. We need as many people as possible to stand with us and show that we will not allow this to happen."*

---

### **Housing Policies Under Scrutiny**

One of the biggest questions this protest raises is: **Why are convicted sex offenders being housed in areas with schools, nurseries, and even near their victims?**

Housing associations like **Bron Afon** are responsible for placing individuals in accommodation, but there are growing concerns that **safeguarding measures are not being properly enforced.**

🔹 **Are risk assessments being conducted before housing placements?**
🔹 **Why was the victim not prioritised in this decision?**
🔹 **Should there be stricter regulations preventing offenders from living near schools?**

Attempts to obtain a **statement from Bron Afon regarding this case** have so far been unsuccessful.

### **Protest Details & How to Get Involved**

📍 **Location:** Bronllys Place, Croesyceiliog, NP44 2DW
🗓️ **Date:** Monday, 17th March
⏰ **Time:** 6 PM

Protest organisers are calling on **local residents, parents, and anyone concerned about child safety** to attend, even if just for **30 minutes**, to show support.

*"We need to stand together as a community. This isn’t just about one case—this is about making sure our children are protected and that those who harm them are not given priority over their safety."*

---

### **The Bigger Picture: A Broken System?**

This case highlights a **much wider issue**—how the **justice system and housing policies handle convicted sex offenders.**

Many feel that **offenders are given more protection than victims**, and without **public pressure**, decisions like this will continue.

📢 **Do you think current housing policies are failing communities? Should stricter laws be in place to prevent situations like this?**

**Let us know your thoughts, and if you are local, join the protest to stand against a system that prioritises offenders over child safety.**
