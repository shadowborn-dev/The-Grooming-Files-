**On Saturday, 29th March 2025**, grassroots justice campaigners from **Predator Awareness** and the **HMP Prisons Justice Group**, led by **Tom Blewitt** and **Zack Griffiths**. Gathered outside **BBC MediaCity in Salford** for a peaceful demonstration against institutional silence, complicity, and decades of cover-ups. What unfolded was more than just a protest — it was **a confrontation between truth and an institution protected by the state**.

What the BBC didn’t expect was **the unwavering resilience of those who’ve had enough**. And what the protesters didn’t expect? **To be physically confronted by BBC staff**. A £200 protest banner pole? **Damaged**. Their speaker, which carried survivor voices and rally calls, **confiscated**. The BBC, which claims impartiality and public service, responded to a peaceful protest with hostility, damage, and silence.

But here’s the truth: **These groups are not here for permission**. They’re here for **accountability**.

### **The Reality of Institutional Betrayal**

For the protesters standing outside MediaCity, this wasn’t just another protest. It was **an act of defiance against decades of systemic failings**, where powerful institutions like the BBC have used their media empire to silence the most vulnerable — survivors of abuse.

**Predator Awareness** has spent over six years fighting for those whose voices have been drowned out by a corporate machine that thrives on maintaining a polished image. From the darkest days of **Jimmy Savile** to the recent failures surrounding **Huw Edwards**, the BBC has shown a blatant disregard for the victims it should protect. Instead, it has shielded perpetrators and spun a narrative of innocence.

The group’s mission? **To expose the lies. Tear down the facade. Demand justice for the victims ignored by institutions like the BBC.**

Tom Blewitt, founder of **Predator Awareness**, didn’t mince words: *“We are here today because we’ve had enough of the BBC’s lies. Enough of their silence. Enough of their complicity in hiding predators.”* His words resonated deeply with countless survivors whose lives have been shattered by the system that should protect them.

### **The BBC's Response to Protesters**

But the BBC didn’t just ignore the protesters. They **actively sought to shut them down**.

Security, hired by the BBC, didn’t come to ensure safety. They came to intimidate. **The protestors’ banner was damaged. A £200 pole was damaged. The speaker — a tool for amplifying the truth — was taken**. The protesters were accused of causing criminal damage, while the BBC staff acted as if they were the victims. A chilling reminder that when powerful institutions feel threatened, they use whatever power they can muster to suppress the truth.

This wasn’t just oppression — it was **institutional gaslighting**, a tactic that has become the hallmark of the BBC’s approach to scandals it tries to bury.

### **The Fight Beyond the Protest: Unseen Battles and Unwavering Resilience**

The truth doesn’t just live in the streets outside **BBC MediaCity**. For **Zack Griffiths**, **Tom Blewitt**, and the **HMP Prisons Justice Group**, this battle goes much deeper. It’s a fight not just against corruption but against the forces that seek to silence them. They’ve been threatened, marginalised, and ignored. Some have been smeared as “troublemakers,” “conspiracy theorists,” or “extremists” — all for speaking the truth.

The emotional toll is profound. The weight of systemic abuse, emotional manipulation, and apathy has nearly broken them. But they keep pushing forward.

**Zack Griffiths**, who leads **HMP Prisons Justice Group**, has long been advocating for prisoners subjected to abuse and systemic neglect. He wasn’t looking for a fight; he was looking for justice for those whose stories have been suppressed. *“This isn’t just about one protest. This is about the years of work, the lives we’ve changed, and the survivors we’ve fought for,”* Zack said. *“This is for the kids who never had a chance to speak. For the families who lost everything.”*

### **The Movement Grows: From Protest to Power**

The protest outside **BBC MediaCity** was a flashpoint. But it’s far from the end of the battle. **Predator Awareness** and **HMP Prisons Justice Group** are more than protest groups. They are movements. And movements don’t fade; they grow, evolve, and gain strength with every person who steps forward.

After the demonstration, the response from the public was overwhelming. **Messages flooded in** from people who’d been waiting for someone to speak out — from victims hiding their pain, from families who watched helplessly as their loved ones were failed by a broken system. They were calling for justice, truth, and accountability — and pledging their support for the groups leading the charge.

This protest sparked **a new wave of voices**, many from people who never imagined standing up to the BBC, but now realised they had no choice. And the message was clear: **They’re not going anywhere**. The battle for justice will continue, no matter the obstacles.

### **Predator Awareness: Reclaiming What Was Stolen**

The growing support shows that **Predator Awareness** and **HMP Prisons Justice Group** are **beacons of hope** for the overlooked and the silenced. They are amplifying the voices that have been drowned out for too long — the voices of survivors, the voices of forgotten victims, the voices the BBC would rather keep quiet.

But this fight isn’t over. **Not by a long shot**.
