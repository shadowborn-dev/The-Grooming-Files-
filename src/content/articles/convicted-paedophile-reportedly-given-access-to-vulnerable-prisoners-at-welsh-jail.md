#### A **CONVICTED** paedophile who was found with videos of babies being abused has allegedly been placed in a position supporting vulnerable young prisoners at a Welsh prison, whistleblowers claim.

William Rutter was previously convicted after authorities discovered a large collection of extreme child sexual abuse material, including graphic videos involving babies. His conviction, reported by Wales Online, highlighted the severity of the offences and the risk he posed to children and vulnerable individuals.

Despite this, sources claim Rutter was appointed as a “neurodiverse buddy” on X Block — a role intended to provide peer support to prisoners with additional needs. It is alleged that while in this role, he sexually assaulted a vulnerable young man inside a prison cell.

Whistleblowers further allege that Rutter routinely approached other prisoners for sex while working on X Block, prompting safeguarding concerns about the safety of those under his care.

Rather than removing him from contact with vulnerable inmates after these alleged incidents, it is claimed Rutter was quietly transferred to Delta Wing, where he was again assigned to support new arrivals on the induction wing.

One insider said:

> 
> “He 100% shouldn’t be left helping vulnerable young boys.”

We understand that if the allegations are substantiated, they would raise urgent questions about safeguarding procedures, risk management, and accountability within the prison service.
