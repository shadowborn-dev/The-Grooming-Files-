**About This Research**
Sophie Lewis is a final-year BA (Hons) Social Sciences student specialising in criminology, forensic psychology, and counselling. This research is conducted independently with full informed consent protocols and trauma-informed methodology. Over three years, Sophie has documented a previously unrecognised offender pattern: exposure-seeking behaviour in individuals with concerning sexual ideation about children.

## Timeline of Events

**October 2023**: Eddie B's case begins with Greater Manchester Police

**January 2024**: Case referred to CPS (after 3 months with police)

**June 2025**: First documented case (Matt) contacts Sophie voluntarily

**August 2025**: Eddie contacts Sophie voluntarily — **20 months into CPS review, 22 months total investigation** — claiming allegations of "receiving inappropriate images of children, and sending inappropriate images of children. Upskirting."

**August 2025**: Full interview conducted with informed consent and signed contract

**October 2025**: Eddie receives **No Further Action (NFA)** — after **24 months under investigation** (21 months with CPS)

**October 2025**: Matt observed continuing online searches consistent with his previous behavioural pattern

**October 29, 2025**: GMP confirms they cannot verify details without additional identifiers beyond his name

---

## The Weight of 24 Months

Eddie didn't reach out to me in a moment of panic. He contacted me **nearly two years deep** into an investigation that had been with CPS for **20 months**.

To put that in context: **average CPS review timelines are 3-6 months**. Eddie's case took **21 months with CPS alone**.

This wasn't impulsive confession. This was **calculated approach** during active CPS proceedings.

He knew he was under investigation.
He knew CPS had been reviewing his case for over a year and a half.
**He reached out anyway.**

---

## What NFA Means After 21 Months with CPS

When CPS holds a case for **21 months** before deciding No Further Action, that's extraordinary.

Standard CPS review timelines are weeks to months, not nearly two years.

**21 months with CPS typically indicates:**

- **Complex digital evidence** requiring extensive forensic analysis

- **Multiple devices or accounts** being examined

- **Cross-jurisdictional complications**

- **Borderline threshold decisions** — evidence exists but charging standard not met

- **Ongoing investigation** whilst CPS advises police on additional evidence needed

**What it doesn't mean:**
That the case was trivial. That nothing was found. That no risk exists.

**CPS doesn't sit on cases for 21 months over nothing.**

---

## The Compulsion to Confess — 20 Months Into CPS Review

The most significant aspect of Eddie's case isn't the NFA.

**It's that he sought journalist exposure whilst CPS was actively reviewing his case for nearly two years.**

In August 2025 — with his case **still under CPS consideration** — Eddie:

- Volunteered explicit details about sexual fantasies involving schoolgirls

- Described recurring arousal at school uniforms ("feeling can come back sometimes when I see schoolgirls")

- Admitted his "darkest thought": "having sex with a schoolgirl in uniform and other things"

- Revealed visits to a dominatrix for punishment over "nawty feelings"

- Confirmed speaking to me gives him the same "rush": **"Yes"**

- Stated his greatest fear is **"people finding out"** — not prison

**He couldn't stop himself from seeking exposure with CPS proceedings 20 months in.**

This is textbook exposure-seeking compulsion.

---

## What Takes 21 Months at CPS?

Between January 2024 and October 2025, what was CPS reviewing?

**The timeline itself tells a story:**

- **Months 1-6**: Initial evidence review, legal advice to police, potential further investigation requested

- **Months 7-12**: Additional evidence gathered, re-reviewed, threshold assessments

- **Months 13-18**: Borderline charging decisions, possibly seeking senior prosecutor review

- **Months 19-21**: Final decision: evidence insufficient for realistic prospect of conviction

**This wasn't a quick dismissal. This was prolonged consideration.**

The three stated allegations were:

- Receiving inappropriate images of children

- Sending inappropriate images of children

- Upskirting

For CPS to spend 21 months on this means **something was there to review**.

---

## Why He Reached Out 20 Months In

Eddie's stated reason: to help me "expose people who prey on children online."

**The reality:**
After 20 months of CPS review, with the outcome still uncertain, **he needed the exposure-shame cycle**.

The investigation alone wasn't providing it. The waiting wasn't enough.

**He needed to perform confession.**

When asked if speaking to me gave him the same rush as his dominatrix sessions, he answered: **"Yes."**

**That single word contains the entire pattern.**

## The Pattern Across Cases

Over three documented cases, a consistent pattern emerges:

**Chris** — sought exposure and shame compulsively
**Matt (June 2025)** — continues to spiral post-exposure; continuing online searches consistent with previous patterns
**Eddie (August 2025)** — sought interview 20 months into CPS review, admitted shame-arousal cycle

All three share:

- Contradictory denials alongside explicit admissions

- Fetishisation of punishment and exposure

- Compulsive outreach despite active risk

- Projection (claiming to help "expose others")

- **Exposure as fuel, not deterrent**

**Matt's continued behaviour proves**: exposure doesn't deter this pattern. It reinforces it.

---

## THE ACCOUNTABILITY GAP

When I attempted to verify Eddie's claims with Greater Manchester Police, I hit a wall that survivors and journalists know well:

> 
> *"Unfortunately, only a name isn't enough and we are unable to do anything without that extra information."*
> — GMP Media Officer, October 29, 2025
> 
> 
> 

**Translation**: Without the very details a subject controls (date of birth, crime reference number), verification is impossible.

**This means:**

- Subjects can claim investigation status without accountability

- Journalists cannot verify claims that could inform public safety

- The public has no way to know if NFA means "innocent" or "insufficient evidence"

- Survivors seeking information face identical barriers

**This isn't just an inconvenience. It's a structural barrier to transparency in cases involving potential risk to children.**

The system protects process over protection. Form over function. Privacy over prevention.

**Meanwhile:**

A man who spent 24 months under investigation for allegations relating to indecent-image offences:

- Admits recurring sexual arousal at schoolgirls in uniform

- Describes explicit fantasies about "schoolgirls in uniform and other things"

- Seeks punishment and exposure as eroticised relief

- **Compulsively approached a journalist mid-investigation**

**And I cannot verify a single detail through official channels.**

---

## What the System Can't See

After 24 months of investigation, 21 months with CPS, and an NFA outcome:

**Eddie walks away with:**

- No charges

- No monitoring

- No intervention

- No therapy requirement

- No restriction

- No record that follows him

**Despite admitting:**

- Recurring sexual arousal at schoolgirls in uniform

- Explicit fantasies about "schoolgirls in uniform and other things"

- Seeking punishment and exposure as eroticised relief

- Compulsive approach to journalist during active CPS review

- Fear of exposure greater than fear of prison

- That confession gives him arousal: "Yes"

**The system says: case closed.**

**The risk markers say: pattern active.**

---

## The Unanswered Questions

**What evidence sustained a 21-month CPS review?**
We don't know. But CPS doesn't review baseless allegations for nearly two years.

**What was found but deemed insufficient?**
Likely below charging threshold — but "insufficient to charge" ≠ "nothing there."

**Why the extraordinary timeline?**
Complex evidence, borderline decisions, or ongoing parallel investigations?

**What happens now?**
Eddie is free. The compulsion remains. No system is watching.

**Will it escalate?**
Matt's case suggests exposure doesn't break the cycle — it reinforces it.

---

## What Should Change

This research identifies a clear gap in current safeguarding approaches. The following recommendations are evidence-based and actionable:

### 1. **Pre-Offence Psychological Risk Assessment Protocols**

Individuals who exhibit exposure-seeking behaviour, shame-arousal cycles, and persistent sexual ideation about children should trigger assessment pathways — **regardless of whether charges are brought**.

### 2. **Mandatory Referral Pathways for Exposure-Seeking Behaviour**

When individuals compulsively seek confession, punishment, or exposure related to sexual thoughts about children, this should be recognised as a **risk marker requiring intervention**, not dismissed as "just thoughts."

### 3. **CPS Guidance on Behavioural Red Flags**

Cases that result in NFA after extended review due to insufficient evidence should include **risk assessment and safeguarding referral protocols** — especially when behavioural indicators are present.

### 4. **Research Funding for Exposure-Seeking Offender Typology**

This pattern has been independently documented across multiple cases. It requires:

- Academic research validation

- Development of screening tools

- Evidence-based intervention protocols

- Training for police, CPS, and safeguarding professionals

### 5. **Transparency in NFA Decisions**

Public interest cases involving allegations relating to indecent-image offences should include:

- Anonymised statistics on NFA reasons

- Distinction between "no evidence" and "insufficient evidence"

- Safeguarding outcome tracking

**Without these changes, individuals like Eddie and Matt will continue to fall through every gap — until they don't.**

---

## Why This Matters

The system operates on binaries: **charged** or **NFA'd**.

There is no category for individuals who:

- Spent 24 months under investigation

- Admit persistent sexual ideation about children

- Seek exposure compulsively during official proceedings

- Eroticise shame and punishment

- Cannot self-regulate even under CPS scrutiny

**Eddie represents what falls through every gap:**

Not charged = not an offender
Admits urges = not "safe"
Seeks exposure = not hiding
**= No framework exists**

---

## The Research Continues

**Three years. Three documented cases. Same pattern. Zero institutional response.**

I have attempted to engage:

- Criminology departments

- Forensic psychology researchers

- Child protection bodies

- Police research units

**I have been largely ignored.**

This is survivor-led, trauma-informed investigative journalism conducted with:

- Full informed consent protocols

- Signed contracts with all participants

- Trauma-informed interview methodology

- Ethical safeguarding throughout

**I am not a vigilante. I am documenting a risk pattern the system refuses to acknowledge.**

Eddie's 24-month investigation ending in NFA doesn't invalidate these findings.

**It proves the system can stare at this pattern for two years and still not see it.**

---

## Conclusion

**The system spent 24 months investigating Eddie.**
**I spent 90 minutes interviewing him.**

In that time, he admitted:

- Recurring sexual arousal at schoolgirls in uniform

- Explicit fantasies he describes as his "darkest thoughts"

- Compulsive need for exposure and punishment

- That speaking to me gives him the same rush as paid domination sessions

The system concluded: **No Further Action.**
The pattern concluded: **Still active.**

**How many more Eddies are out there, cycling through shame and arousal, waiting for someone to notice before they cross the line?**

**And how many children will pay the price whilst we wait for the system to catch up to what it refuses to see?**
