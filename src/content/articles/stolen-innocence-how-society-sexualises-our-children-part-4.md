## **Who Profits **From The** Normalisation?**

We’ve exposed the layers already:

- **Culture and fashion are sexualising children.**

- **Porn is grooming their minds.**

- **Education is normalising the narrative.**

But none of this is organic. None of it is accidental.
**It is driven by profit. By ideology. By power.**

Let’s be blunt: **Children are now a target market.**
**Their innocence is being strip-mined for cash, data, and cultural engineering.**

**Here is how the machine works.**

## Big Porn — Addiction As Business Model

Global** porn industry worth: ove**r **£90 billion**.

Big Porn is no longer a seedy backroom business, it is run by multinational corporations with ties to:

- Advertising giants

- Data brokers

- Lobbying firms

- “Education” charities

**Pornhub alone is owned by MindGeek, which controls a vast portion of global online porn distribution.**
Its business model is simple:
**Hook them young.**
**Keep them addicted.**
**Collect their data**.
**Monetise every click.**

Porn platforms use:

- **Machine learning** to drive escalation of content

- **Search engine manipulation** to target children and teens

- **Paid partnerships** with "sex-positive" influencers to normalise porn to Gen Z and Gen Alpha

**Even so-called “ethical porn” is a gateway drug.**
Once you have a child normalised to one layer of content, the algorithm drives them deeper to more violent, more extreme material.

And the earlier this starts, the more valuable that user is for **decades of clicks**.

## Big Tech — The Silent Enabler

Every major social platform **profits from the sexualisation of children**.
Not because their execs are paedophiles (mostly) but because **sexualised content drives engagement.**
And engagement = ad revenue.

**How it works:**

- TikTok, Instagram and YouTube algorithms promote **underage creators who get high engagement**

- Comments from adult men drive the algorithm to promote those videos further

- **AI tools used by platforms are trained on engagement, not ethics**

- Attempts to block this are deliberately weak because if they worked, **they would lose money**

**Meta, Google, ByteDance (TikTok), Snap — they all know. They all profit. They all look the other way.**

And if parents object?
They are gaslit: *“You don’t understand youth culture.”*

## Fashion & Retail — Selling Adult Fantasy To Children

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000ecc462468395aec8338f732d5184615063868002980.png?w=683)

The fashion industry is now deeply complicit.

- High street brands push sexualised clothing for pre-teens and toddlers

- Influencers as young as 5 are promoted wearing crop tops, makeup, adult styling

- “Mini me” collections deliberately mimic adult sexualised trends — and are cross-marketed to **paedophile-run forums and fetish sites** (documented cases).

Brands that have been called out include:

- H&M

- Shein

- Zara

- Primark

But this is not an accident.
Sexualised kids’ clothes photograph better.
They perform better on Instagram.
They sell more units.

And when a child dresses adult, predators respond, driving engagement and fuelling the market.

## Ideological Capture — The Trojan Horse Of "Progress"

One of the **most sinister arms of this agenda** is how it is now being laundered through “progressive” ideology.
Activist networks, charities, and NGOs, many directly or indirectly funded by **Big Porn and Big Tech** push narratives like:

- “Porn literacy” for children

- “Consent workshops” that normalise kink and BDSM to 12-year-olds

- “Queer-inclusive sex education” that often means **graphic material without parental consent**

**Some of these groups receive grants from the very companies profiting from the sexualisation of children.**

This is not about rights.
It is about **rewiring how children see their own bodies and boundaries**,** to make them better consumers of the industry’s products.**

**If innocence is a social construct, it can be dismantled.**
And if it is dismantled, the market expands.

## The Global Network — How It All Connects

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000d9e46246a7d5becf8262349f5766590942904203362.png?w=1024)

**This is not isolated. It is coordinated.**

- Big Porn funds activist groups.

- Activist groups lobby governments for “inclusive” education.

- Tech companies promote sexualised content under “youth culture.”

- Fashion brands feed demand through influencer marketing.

- Data brokers profit from every click, share, and reaction.

**Children are the product.**
**Their data is harvested.**
**Their sexuality is commodified.**
**Their innocence is erased for profit.**

---

## The Ultimate Cost

What this means in practice:

- Children unable to form healthy sexual boundaries

- Normalisation of abuse and exploitation

- Escalating child-on-child sexual harm

- Entire generations groomed to accept porn, abuse and hypersexuality as normal

And all of it happens because **powerful industries are making billions and activists are providing the ideological cover to make it unstoppable.**

---

## What We Must Do

**Name the profiteers.**
**Expose their funding networks.**
**Refuse the language games**, **this is not progress, it is predation.**
**Reclaim childhood from the machine.**

Because **if we do not, we will lose an entire generation, not just to trauma, but to cultural captivity.**
