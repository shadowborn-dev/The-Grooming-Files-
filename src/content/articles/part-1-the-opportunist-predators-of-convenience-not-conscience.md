It didn’t start with grooming. It started with a silence.

She was asleep. He was nearby. Maybe he was a friend of the family, a boyfriend, a trusted co-worker, or even a stranger at a party. But in that moment, something clicked — and he decided her silence was permission.

This is the Opportunist.
He’s not driven by obsession, or strategy, or months of manipulation. He’s driven by one thing: *opportunity*.

And he takes it.

## **“It Just Happened” — The Predator’s Favourite Lie**

Opportunist predators are dangerous precisely because they don’t fit the expected mould. They may not spend months building trust, nor belong to organised networks. Instead, they rely on fleeting windows: intoxication, isolation, a lapse in supervision, or emotional vulnerability.

They are the ones who say:

> 
> “I didn’t mean to.”
> “I thought she wanted it.”
> “She didn’t say no.”
> 
> 
> 

But absence of resistance is not consent. And silence isn’t approval — it’s context. The Opportunist weaponises moments where consent can’t be given and then retreats into denial.

---

## **A Pattern That Hides in Plain Sight**

They’re often “nice guys.” The one who walked her home. The one who “stayed to help.” The one everyone said would never do something like that. Until he did.

Many Opportunists:

- Offend while drunk or under the influence — then blame it.

- Take advantage of power imbalances without acknowledging them.

- Exploit moments of chaos, transition, or disorientation (after a party, during a breakup, when someone’s grieving or vulnerable).

Because their harm is tied to a specific moment — rather than a long campaign — it’s easier for others to dismiss it. Victims may question their own memory. Bystanders may excuse the predator’s behaviour as a “mistake.” The legal system may fail to act because it doesn’t fit a pre-planned model.

---

## **They Rarely Do It Just Once**

The myth is that these are “one-off” offenders. But data and survivor testimony suggest otherwise. Once someone has crossed the line — and seen how easy it is to avoid consequences — the likelihood of repeat offending increases.

He didn’t “accidentally” touch someone while they were passed out. He took the opportunity, then rationalised it.
He didn’t “misread signals” — he ignored the absence of them.

This isn’t about miscommunication. It’s about absence of care.

---

## **The System’s Weakest Link**

Opportunist predators thrive in environments with:

- **Lack of supervision**

- **Cultural silence around boundaries**

- **Victim-blaming**

- **Misunderstandings of consent**

That means workplaces, schools, parties, prisons, institutions, domestic settings — any space where oversight is patchy and power can shift moment to moment.

---

## **Why This Typology Matters**

Because Opportunists challenge everything we assume about abuse. That it’s always planned. That it’s always targeted. That it’s always part of a pattern.

But sometimes the only pattern is: *if he can, he will.*

And that’s why prevention isn’t just about watching for suspicious behaviour. It’s about creating cultures where consent is respected as the baseline — not the exception. Where silence isn’t a gap to exploit. And where accountability exists even when a predator says *“I didn’t plan it.”*

Because what he did was no accident.

**He didn’t lose control. He took it.**
