## Over *3*0 Pages of Police, Prison & Court Personnel Charged with Offences — and the System That Let Them Operate Anyway

---

Over 30 pages.
Hundreds of names.
Sexual assault. Child abuse. Domestic violence.
And that’s just the officers we know about.

Our teams have obtained a full, verified list documenting police, prison, and court officials across the UK who were **charged or convicted** of serious offences between 2009 and 2023.

It’s a list the public was never meant to see all at once.
Because when you read them together—not scattered in one-off headlines or buried in court transcripts—**the pattern is undeniable**.

These are not isolated incidents.
**This is a system that protects itself.**

---

### **THE RECKONING: MORE THAN “A FEW BAD APPLES”**

Among the findings:

- Officers charged with **rape**, still listed as "proceeding"

- Child sex abuse cases buried under **internal reviews**

- **Suspended sentences** handed to violent offenders

- Known predators allowed to **resign quietly** or be “retrained”

- Multiple convictions from the **same forces**—including the Met, GMP, and Devon & Cornwall

Each one of these names wore a uniform.
Many held authority over victims.
Some still do.

And behind them? A wall of silence.
Thin blue lines. PR shields. Minimal press.

---

### **WHAT THE DATA SHOWS**

This document, compiled from public records, tracks **over 30 pages of police, prison, and justice personne**l who were **charged or convicted** of offences between 2009 and 2023.

The snapshot you’re seeing today reflects just a portion of what's inside. Between January and June 2023 alone:

- **At least 7 officers** were charged with rape or serious sexual assault

- **6 officers and staff** were jailed for child sex offences or indecent images of children

- **Multiple cases involved repeat offenders from the same forces**, including the Metropolitan Police, Greater Manchester Police, and Devon & Cornwall

- Some cases ended in **resignation, suspension or even no action taken**, despite serious allegations

- The majority received **short sentences** or **suspended terms**—even in cases involving violence, child abuse, or abuse of power

Each name is linked to a force. Each offence is recorded. Each result shows us how justice was handled—or mishandled—**within the very system meant to enforce it**.

These are not accusations.
**They are confirmed charges, convictions, and proceedings.**
Many were reported by mainstream media, but never shown together like this.

---

### **SELECTED CASES: JUST A FRACTION OF THE FILE**

**Metropolitan Police – April 2023**
A serving Met officer was charged with **rape**. Listed as “proceeding.” Still under employment at the time of charge.

**Greater Manchester Police – March 2023**
An officer received a **suspended sentence** after being convicted of **assaulting his partner**. No internal misconduct outcome disclosed.

**Devon & Cornwall Police – May 202**3
A custody sergeant was convicted of **possessing indecent images of children**. Resigned before sentencing. Avoided jail.

**HMP Staff Member – February 2023**
Charged with **misconduct in public office** after being caught in an inappropriate relationship with a prisoner. Case marked “discontinued.”

**Court Security Officer – January 2023**
Convicted of **harassment and coercive control**. No national media coverage. Allowed to resign without official misconduct sanctions.

**West Midlands Police – June 2023**
Officer jailed for **domestic violence**, including strangulation. The force declined to comment when asked if any safeguarding failures occurred.

---

These cases are not rare.
They’re routine. Repetitive. Systemic.
And they raise one unavoidable question:

> 
> **How many were quietly moved, protected, or forgotten—while still wearing the uniform of trust?**
> 
> 
> 

---

### **THE PATTERN: NOT ROTTEN APPLES. A ROTTEN STRUCTURE.**

When you lay these cases side by side, the pattern is impossible to ignore.

- **Sexual misconduct, violence, child abuse, coercion, exploitation—committed by those in positions of authority.**

- Charges met with **resignations instead of dismissals.**

- **Minimal press coverage** unless the crime is too big to ignore.

- Outcomes that favour **reputation management over public accountability.**

- Internal investigations that result in **no further action, or quiet suspension.**

These are **not just failures—they’re strategic silences**. A system designed to absorb the shock, protect the institution, and wait for public attention to fade.

For every one officer charged, how many victims stayed quiet?
For every one case reported, how many were buried?
And for every badge that slipped through the cracks—who held the door open?

---

### **CALL FOR ACCOUNTABILITY**

The Indie Leaks is now calling for:

- A **full national audit** of all misconduct charges brought against UK police, prison, and court staff from 2009 to present

- Transparent publication of disciplinary outcomes—**not just convictions, but internal actions**

- Whistleblower protections for officers and staff exposing corruption inside the system

- A review of how misconduct is handled across forces—and how many are allowed to quietly resign without scrutiny

Because this isn’t about scandal. It’s about **systemic danger**. And we won’t look away.
