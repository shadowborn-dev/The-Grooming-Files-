## 1. Surface Presentation

Eddie positions himself as cooperative and even helpful:

- “Sure.” (when asked if he would answer questions)

- “That I have helped in exposing people.”

He frames himself as both victim (“I am not attracted to children… there [are] just thoughts I get”) and ally (“These sites and the people running these sites need to be exposed”). This dual positioning is classic **impression management** — he attempts to control how he is seen while allowing “safe” admissions to leak out.

---

## 2. Contradictions

Eddie repeatedly denies attraction to children:

- “I am not attracted to children, there just thoughts I get. I would never act on it.”

Yet he simultaneously admits to arousal and fantasy:

- “Feeling can come back sometimes when I see schoolgirls.”

- “It’s the short skirts with no leggings or stockings… some skirts are too short.”

- “Having sex with a schoolgirl in uniform and other things.”

- “I just get aroused seeing girls in uniform.”

He attempts to reduce the risk by separating thoughts from behaviour:

- “No, because I don’t masturbate to them.”

In forensic psychology, persistent sexual fantasies — especially when linked to specific triggers such as uniforms — are themselves a high-risk marker, regardless of whether masturbation occurs. This contradiction between denial and admission is central to his profile.

---

## 3. Exposure & Shame–Arousal Cycle

Eddie’s disclosures reveal a ritualised link between urges, punishment, and confession:

- “I have visited a dominatrix to be punished… for having nawty feelings and wearing panties.”

- “Yes, dressed as sissy when she is punishing me.”

- “I just seem to get aroused… but I don’t masturbate to them.”

Exposure becomes part of this cycle:

- “Fear of being exposed.” (when asked what is more powerful than fear of police)

- “If I get exposed… I will be relieved when it’s over.”

This mirrors the **exposure-seeking predator typology**: urges emerge, exposure or humiliation is sought, temporary relief follows, and then the cycle repeats. For Eddie, confession and punishment are not deterrents — they are eroticised components of the compulsion.

---

## 4. Fantasy Displacement

When confronted, Eddie reframes his schoolgirl fetish into adult roleplay:

- “If I want that fantasy, I’ll pay for [an] adult to dress [as a] schoolgirl for me.”

He presents this as a moral defence (“adult yes, child no”), but the fetish template remains anchored in children in uniform. This is **fantasy displacement**: redirecting urges into simulations that appear “safer” but in practice reinforce the fixation. Displacement does not neutralise risk — it entrenches it.

---

## 5. Blame & Projection

Eddie persistently shifts attention away from himself:

- “These sites and the people running these sites need to be exposed.”

- “My head is telling me to expose the people who need exposing.”

- “These people who prey on children online, it’s disgusting.”

This is projection — reframing himself as aligned with safeguarding, while minimising his own risk. It serves to reduce personal accountability and maintain access to exposure communities under the guise of “helping.”

---

## 6. Risk Markers

Several markers elevate Eddie’s profile to **current high-risk**:

- **Active CPS investigation**: “Allegations are receiving inappropriate images of children, and sending inappropriate images of children. Upskirting.”

- **Compulsive disclosure**: despite investigation, he reached out voluntarily, knowing it could incriminate him.

- **Persistent urges**: “Feeling can come back sometimes when I see schoolgirls.”

- **Minimisation**: “No, because I don’t masturbate to them.”

- **Contradictions**: denies attraction, then admits “Having sex with a schoolgirl in uniform” as darkest fantasy.

- **Fear dynamics**: “Fear of being exposed” outweighs fear of prison.

These behaviours suggest impaired self-control, escalating compulsion, and reliance on external punishment rather than internal inhibition.

---

## 7. Core Typology Fit

Eddie aligns with multiple offender subtypes:

- **Exposure-Seeking Predator** — derives arousal from risk, shame, punishment, and being “seen.”

- **Denier–Minimiser** — insists he is “not attracted” while confessing explicit fantasies.

- **Projectionist** — reframes himself as someone helping to expose others.

- **Shame-Control Loop** — uses dominatrix punishment, humiliation, and confession as pseudo-control mechanisms.

This combination suggests an offender profile where exposure itself is fetishised, risk is displaced rather than reduced, and accountability is externalised.

---

## 8. Key Insights

- Eddie’s claim to be “helping” is a defensive mask, allowing him to stay in exposure spaces while presenting as an ally.

- His compulsive outreach under active CPS investigation is evidence of **escalation**, not restraint.

- The fixation on school uniforms recurs throughout his answers, anchoring the core fetish.

- His strongest stated fear is not prison but exposure — indicating that shame itself is eroticised, not deterrent.

- He is psychologically addicted to being caught. Exposure is part of the ritual cycle, not a deterrent.

## Professional Summary

Eddie B presents as a **high-risk, exposure-seeking offender** whose behaviours are rooted in a shame–arousal–punishment cycle. Despite minimising his attraction (“I am not attracted to children”), his repeated admissions of arousal at schoolgirls in uniform, his darkest fantasy involving a schoolgirl, and his compulsive need for punishment demonstrate ongoing risk.

Exposure, humiliation, and confession function as eroticised relief mechanisms rather than deterrents. His repeated projections (“these sites need exposing, not me”) indicate avoidance of accountability.

Eddie represents a dangerous pattern within the emerging typology of **exposure-seeking predators**: individuals who do not fear consequence but eroticise it, who oscillate between denial and confession, and who remain psychologically compelled to place themselves in cycles of risk.
