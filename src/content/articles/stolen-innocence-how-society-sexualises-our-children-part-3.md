In theory, schools should be the firewall between children and exploitation.
A place where healthy relationships, respect, consent, and safety are taught.
But in 2025, that firewall is riddled with holes — and in some cases, is actively helping the flames spread.

**Across the UK and beyond, 'progressive' education agendas and unregulated PSHE (Personal, Social, Health & Economic education) content are exposing children to ideas and imagery that many parents would never consent to — if they knew.**

Let’s be clear:
Sex education matters.
Consent education matters.
Inclusion matters.

**But pushing graphic, adult-themed materials on children under the banner of “modern learning” is not education. It’s grooming society to normalise the very same sexualisation we’ve exposed in Parts 1 and 2.**

## What’s Really Happening in Classrooms?

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000ef9461f988eb92b4661a4d537265010841027584570.png?w=1024)

Over the past five years, countless UK parents have raised the alarm about PSHE and RSE (Relationships & Sex Education) content in schools.

**The common patterns:**

- **Explicit sexual acts described or depicted** — sometimes to children as young as 7 or 8.

- **Materials normalising kinks, BDSM, and fetishes** under the guise of "inclusive" education — pushed on teens without context.

- **Porn-positive messaging** — encouraging "exploration" of online porn as "normal" or "healthy curiosity."

- **Books and visual aids containing highly graphic sexual content** being used in class without parental transparency.

- **Resources provided by third-party NGOs** with little or no accountability — often linked to activist funding, not education standards.

## Who’s Behind These Materials?

In many cases, schools aren't writing this content — they’re buying it.

**Private organisations and charities** now provide "off-the-shelf" RSE packs. Some are excellent. Many are not. And **parents rarely see what’s inside before it's delivered to their kids.**

Some organisations pushing the most radical content have:

- Direct links to the **sex industry.**

- Funding from **pornography lobby groups.**

- Close ties to **political movements** that view childhood innocence as a “social construct” to be dismantled.

**This is not a conspiracy theory — it is documented fact.**
But every time parents object, they’re gaslit: *"You're bigoted. You're anti-progress. You're not sex-positive."*

## How Porn Culture Filters Into Class

This isn’t accidental.
When children are sexualised by culture and online content (Parts 1 and 2), education is the final layer that can either: ✅ **Challenge it.**
❌ **Normalise it.**

Right now, many schools are normalising it:

- Presenting pornographic content as *inevitable* — rather than challenging its harm.

- Telling children that **all sexual desires are valid** — without giving them the tools to understand abuse, coercion, or consent properly.

- Teaching complex adult concepts about **gender, sexuality, and identity** without ensuring that children understand their own bodies, safety, and boundaries first.

**The result:** a generation that knows every label and every kink — but can’t spot grooming when it happens.

## Where Are the Safeguards?

The Department for Education claims there is guidance in place.
But here’s the truth:

- There is **no national curriculum** for RSE — just guidelines.

- Materials are often delivered by **unregulated third parties.**

- Parents are **routinely denied full access** to preview content.

- Schools fear legal challenges or public backlash if they object to activist-driven content — so they comply.

**In this vacuum, extreme content has crept in — and most parents are none the wiser.**

## Real-World Cases

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_000000009bac61f9af2149927ae361935521185294946886201.png?w=1024)

**In 2023, a primary school in London faced backlash after showing Year 4 children materials that included descriptions of masturbation and sexual acts.**
**In 2024, a group of Welsh parents discovered their children had been taught about “safe choking” and “bondage” as part of a Year 9 relationships lesson.**
**In 2025, a national audit revealed that many RSE resources used in UK classrooms had not been vetted by educational psychologists or child safeguarding experts.**

**This is not education. This is indoctrination — and it is grooming children to view sexualisation as normal and desirable.**

---

## Why It Matters

Because if children are: 

**Exposed to sexualised media.**
**Drawn into pornified mindsets.**
**Then taught in class that all of    this is just “being open-minded” or “progressive” —**

**You have the perfect storm.**

**You create a generation that is less likely to report grooming.**
**Less likely to recognise exploitation.**
**Less likely to have any sense of where healthy boundaries truly lie.**

**And the predators know it.**
**And the profiteers know it.**

## What Should We Be Teaching?

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000a6f461f9ad193ceb84ccfb2a6127772207732115914.png?w=1024)

Here’s what children really need:

- **Early, age-appropriate education about bodily autonomy, privacy, and boundaries.**

- **Clear understanding of what healthy relationships look like — based on respect and consent.**

- **Honest conversations about the dangers of porn and online exploitation.**

- **Critical thinking — so they can see through grooming tactics.**

- **Tools to say NO and to recognise abuse.**

**Not graphic sex tips. Not kink content. Not porn promotion. Not ideology.**

---

### If a stranger on the street told your 8-year-old about sex acts, you’d call the police.
If it happens in a classroom, we’re told to celebrate it.

**We are gaslighting an entire generation. And they will pay the price — unless we stop it.**

---

## What’s next?

In Part 4, we’ll follow the money: **Who profits from this normalisation?**
And why is big tech, big porn, and certain activist networks so desperate to dismantle childhood innocence?
