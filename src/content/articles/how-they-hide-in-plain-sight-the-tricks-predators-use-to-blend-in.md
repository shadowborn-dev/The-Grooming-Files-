#### **He shook your hand. He smiled at you. He held open the door. And you never suspected a thing.**

Because **predators don’t look like monsters.**

They look like people you trust.

The teacher.
The bus driver.
The shopkeeper.
The mate’s older brother.
The one everyone liked.

They were always **there**—and that’s why no one saw them.

They weren’t hiding in the dark. They were standing **right in the light.**

Because the truth is, **they don’t need to hide.**

They just need you **not to notice.**

## **The Many Faces of a Predator**

We grew up thinking predators were **strange, creepy men who couldn’t blend in.**

That’s the **biggest lie society ever told us.**

The reality? **There isn’t just one type of predator.** They don’t all look or act the same. That’s how they stay unnoticed.

**The Protector** – The ‘big brother’ type, always looking out for you. He makes you feel safe—until one day, *he’s* the one you need to be protected from.

**The Cool Guy** – The one with the car, the money, the confidence. He makes young girls feel important, special, mature. *He makes it look like you chose him.*

**The Misunderstood One** – The quiet one, the ‘nice guy’, the one who plays the victim. He tells you *no one understands him except you*. He pulls you in with **pity, not power.**

**The Ghost** – The secretive one. No one knows much about him. He doesn’t draw attention, doesn’t seem like a threat. But behind closed doors? **He’s worse than all of them.**

Some of them are **loud and charming**. Some are **quiet and invisible**.

But they all do **one thing the same.**

**They make you trust them.**

And by the time you realise?

**It’s already too late.**

## **How They Stay Undetected**

**They don’t just get away with it—they create a world where they’re untouchable.**

**They act differently in public.**

- **In front of people?** They’re friendly, polite, normal.

- **Behind closed doors?** They are **predators.**

**They build reputations that protect them.**

- They’re the ones **everyone respects.**

- They’re **trusted members of the community.**

- They make sure that *if someone ever speaks out against them*, people will say, *“Not him. He’d never do that.”*

**They surround themselves with easy targets.**

- They **seek out vulnerability**—girls who are young, unsure of themselves, looking for attention.

- They make you **feel special, feel chosen—until they take what they really wanted.**

By the time anyone realises what they are?

**They’ve already moved on to their next victim.**

## **Real Moments – The Signs We Ignored**

Looking back, **there were so many signs.**

**The shopkeeper** who was *too friendly, always lingering, always **complimenting** young girls.*

**The teacher** who *only ever seemed interested in talking to the girls, never the boys.*

**The bus driver** who *kept finding excuses to talk, to ‘accidentally’ brush too close, to joke in ways that didn’t feel right.*

**But we didn’t know.**

We thought it was **normal.**

We brushed it off because **no one else seemed to see it.**

But **they knew.**

They knew **exactly what they were doing.**

---

## **Most of Them Are Still Out There.**

The worst part? **Most of them never got caught.**

They’re still **out there, living their lives, doing the same thing to new victims.**

**Why? Because we’ve made it easy for them.**

**Nobody wants to believe a predator can be ‘one of the good ones.’**

**Nobody wants to question the trusted teacher, the nice guy, the friendly stranger.**

**Nobody wants to think about how many of them still walk free.**

So we **pretend not to see.**

And they **keep getting away with it.**

---

## **The Biggest Truth People Need to Face**

**Predators don’t look like monsters. They look like people you trust.**

They **aren’t stupid.** They **aren’t obvious.** They **know exactly how to blend in.**

**It’s time we stop thinking of them as strangers in the dark.**

**It’s time we stop assuming we’d ‘just know’ if someone was dangerous.**

**It’s time we start seeing them for what they really are.**

Because **they’re still out there.**

**How many more victims will there be before we stop pretending we can’t see them?**

---

### **They’ve stayed hidden long enough.**

It’s time to see what we missed—**and make sure it never gets ignored again.**
