Multiple serious medical incidents were allegedly reported inside HMP Parc on 21st of March 2025, including three separate “code blue” alerts, an attempted suicide by hanging, and a suspected spice overdose across two different wings.

Messages received from families with loved ones inside the prison describe a chaotic day involving several medical emergencies. One message read:

> 
> *“Spoke to my LO today. He said three code blues on A wing today — all different areas. In addition, one man tried to hang himself on A1 today. Sounds like a lot has gone on in there today.”*
> 
> 
> 

It’s understood the individual who allegedly attempted to hang himself was taken to hospital by ambulance and later returned to the prison. The nature of his condition and the response provided remain unconfirmed by prison authorities.

## **Overdose on A3 Wing?**

In a separate thread of concern, another incident reportedly took place on A3 wing involving a suspected spice overdose. One user wrote:

> 
> *“My partner said the man in the cell next door got taken away by ambulance — they had to revive him. Spice overdose.”*
> 
> 
> 

Another added:

> 
> *“It looked like fast response, not police… spice going round is stronger than usual.”*
> 
>

Members of the public and families voiced shock at the continued circulation of dangerous substances behind bars:

> 
> *“Hope he will be OK and never touches that poison again.”*

## **What Is a Code Blue?**

In UK prisons, a “code blue” is understood to refer to medical emergencies involving breathing difficulties, collapse, or unconsciousness. These often include overdoses or suicide attempts. While prison protocol may vary slightly between facilities, staff typically initiate an urgent response that can involve healthcare teams and emergency services.

## **Allegations and Accountability**

HMP Parc — operated by private contractor G4S — has faced repeated public concern in recent months regarding prisoner welfare, mental health access, and contraband entering the prison. Allegations of spice circulation and inadequate safety measures have been raised before, but families say meaningful change has yet to be seen.

A HMP Prisons Justice Group, page admin, responded:

> 
> *“Think it was a fast response ambulance, not police — unless police were there another time.”*
> 
> 
> 

At the time of publication, G4S has not confirmed or commented on any of the alleged incidents described above. A request for comment has been submitted and any official response will be added in due course.
