I didn’t write this for pity. I wrote it to expose a mindset the media refuses to face.

Over the course of three days, I conducted what should’ve been one of the most disturbing, important pieces of survivor-led journalism this year: a full written and video-recorded interview with a convicted offender who groomed children online. He *came to me* — voluntarily — and I documented every single word. With consent. On record. No filter.

And what’s the response been?

**Silence.**

Not one editor replied. Not one media outlet asked to see it. Not one institution had the guts to say, *“This is hard to look at — but necessary.”*

They didn’t say no.

They said *nothing*.

And that says *everything*.

### **They Say They Want Accountability — Until It’s Real**

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_00000000f8a4620aae1feb538d6af300_conversation_id3d67fae4e9-3b74-8002-878b-470c0fe4913f26message_id3dd0cd31b1-fb05-4e3b-ac35-878093f913537571303945737029946.jpg?w=683)

Every outlet screams for survivor stories when they’re tragic, soft-focus, wrapped in ribbons of resilience. They want the trauma — not the confrontation. They want headlines that weep, not ones that *bite*.

But what happens when a survivor flips the script?

What happens when one of us *asks the questions* no one else will?

What happens when we sit in the room — across from the darkness — and don’t flinch?

**Apparently, nothing.**

Apparently, that’s *too much*.

### **Let’s Call It What It Is: Editorial Cowardice**

This interview wasn’t entertainment. It was evidence. The 17-minute video was calm, steady, and **chilling** in its lack of remorse. His words — on grooming, guilt, and loss — weren’t sensational. They were **clinical**. **Real**. And that’s what makes it powerful.

But the moment I tried to platform that?

*Crickets.*

### **Where Was the Support?**

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_000000009ef8620a85cc2a21aec20c27_conversation_id3d67fae4e9-3b74-8002-878b-470c0fe4913f26message_id3ded4d96dc-2cc0-4126-b6b8-5c2b551d61fe281295711093148704900639.jpg?w=1024)

I reached out to my university.  Where I studied criminology, where we were taught to interrogate harm, power, and silence. I wasn’t silenced. I was met with caution, policy, and a cold referral chain. And that’s just as revealing.

I contacted media outlets. Silence.

I pitched it, framed it, softened it, screamed it. **Silence.**

And now I understand why:

They don’t want truth.

They want *presentation*.

They want click-ready captions, trauma with a digestible arc, and “voices” that can be neatly slotted between a celeb scandal and the weather report.

**I’m not here to be neat.**

---

### **This Work Was Done Without a Paycheck, a Safety Net, or a Publishing House**

I did this on my own.

No grant.
No legal team.
No institutional protection.

I took the risk. I felt the toll. I *held the line*.

And what did I get for it?

Not a single fucking door opened.

---

### **But That’s Fine. I’ve Got a Match.**

Because now I’m writing the *real* story:

Not just of a predator’s words — but of a system that would rather you never hear them.

Of media platforms that turn their heads when truth comes from the “wrong voice.”

Of universities who teach justice theory — but panic the moment it turns real.

Of a world that will platform predators in dramas and documentaries — but look away when the raw, unscripted version lands in their inbox.

---

### **Let Me Be Clear**

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/file_0000000019f4620a9c125547980a2354_conversation_id3d67fae4e9-3b74-8002-878b-470c0fe4913f26message_id3d9fda1fb9-ce3a-4b34-8b21-05fe291425266833054424648121481.jpg?w=683)

This exposé is going to be published.

**All of it.**
The full video.
The message logs.
The analysis.
The cost.
The truth.

And when it drops?

Don’t come knocking, asking for a feature.

Don’t say, *“Wow, this is important.”*
You had your chance.

### **This Was Never About Him. It’s About the Silence Around Him**

They didn’t reject my work.
They ignored it.
Because it didn’t come gift-wrapped in guilt porn or trauma chic.
Because it wasn’t palatable.
Because it was **real**.

But here’s what they don’t understand:

**I don’t need their green light.**
**I brought the gasoline.**

If no one wants to open the door,
**I’ll burn down the fucking wall.**

This story *will* come out.

And this time — I’m not asking permission.
