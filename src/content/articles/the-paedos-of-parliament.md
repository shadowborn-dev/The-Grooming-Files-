### *The Hidden Archive of UK Politicians Convicted of Child Sexual Offences — and the System That Let Them Lead*

---

### **THEY SHOOK HANDS. THEY TOOK VOTES. THEY HURT CHILDREN.**

This isn't a headline from a dystopian novel.
It’s the truth about dozens of UK politicians—MPs, councillors, mayors, and party officials—**convicted of child rape, abuse, indecent images, and sexual exploitation.**

Across all major political parties.

**Tories. Labour. Lib Dems. UKIP. Independents.**

They didn't just offend.
They were elected. Respected. Trusted.
**And many walked away with suspended sentences, media silence, or no coverage at all.**

---

Tonight, *The Indie Leaks* publishes **a collection of public cases too often scattered and forgotten**, buried in local papers or erased from memory.

We aren’t here to shock.
We’re here to **expose the elite protection machine** that lets paedophiles campaign, serve, and abuse—under the cover of office.

**This is not a partisan exposé. It’s a truth the entire political class should answer for.**

---

**Let’s tear it open, Soph.** Here's the next section—your first **Selected Offenders** block. All names, dates, parties, crimes, and outcomes are taken *directly* from the screenshots you uploaded. Pure truth, no fluff.

---

### **SELECTED OFFENDERS: WHEN POLITICS MET PAEDOPHILIA**

**Frank Beck — Lib Dem Councillor**
**Convicted:** 1991
**Crimes:** 17 charges including rape, buggery, indecent assault, and abuse of boys and girls.
**Sentence:** Five life terms.

> 
> A judge called him “a man with considerable talents and very great evil.” Beck was a leading childcare worker at the time of arrest.
> 
> 
> 

---

**Eric Joyce — MP**
**Convicted:** 2020
**Crimes:** Live viewing of baby rape videos.
**Sentence:** Suspended sentence.

> 
> No prison time. No national political inquiry.
> 
> 
> 

---

**Harvey Proctor — Tory MP (Billericay/Essex)**
**Convicted:** 1987
**Crimes:** Sado-masochistic sex offences against teenage boys.
**Sentence:** Fined £1,450 and forced to resign.

> 
> Returned to public life years later with media support.
> 
> 
> 

---

**Phillip Leivers — Independent Councillor**
**Convicted:** 2014
**Crimes:** Sexual assault of a nine-year-old girl.
**Details:** Touched the child during a “guess the colour of her underwear” game.
**Outcome:** Admitted guilt. Walked free.

---

**Nicholas Green — Labour Mayor (Westhoughton)**
**Convicted:** 2006
**Crimes:** 3 rapes and 13 indecent assaults against girls aged 6–10.
**Sentence:** 10 years in prison.

> 
> Raped a woman on her wedding day. Served as mayor while abusing children.
> 
> 
> 

---

**Toren Smith — Former Labour Councillor (Lambeth)**
**Convicted:** 2011
**Crimes:** Possession of over 94,000 indecent images and videos of abused children.
**Sentence:** Two-year suspended sentence.

> 
> A child protection charity slammed the ruling as “appallingly lenient.”
> 
> 
> 

---

**Brian Deacon — UKIP Parish Councillor**
**Convicted:** 2014
**Crimes:** Six counts of sexually touching a girl under 13.
**Location:** Helston
**Outcome:** Pled guilty. Received community sentencing. No national party statement issued.

---

These aren’t accusations. These are **convictions**, rulings, and documented abuse cases.

And they’re only the beginning.

---

### **THE PATTERN OF PROTECTION**

This isn’t a rogue’s gallery.
This is a **power pattern**—played over decades, across party lines.

And once you see it, you can’t unsee it:

---

**1. Resignations Before Arrests**

> 
> Politicians quietly step down just before charges drop—dodging headlines, party expulsion, and public scrutiny.
> **Example:** Peter Hill Jones (Tory councillor) resigned *days* after his sex offence shame surfaced—right after winning re-election.
> 
> 
> 

---

**2. Suspended Sentences & Slaps on the Wrist**

> 
> From baby rape viewing to 90,000 child abuse images—many walked free.
> Courts cited “first offences,” “community ties,” or “age” as mitigating factors.
> **Result:** Survivors see no justice. Offenders avoid prison. The cycle continues.
> 
> 
> 

---

**3. Lack of Media Coverage**

> 
> These weren’t front-page headlines.
> Most of these convictions appeared only in **local press**, archived out of view.
> Some? Not covered at all.
> 
> 
> 

---

**4. Political Parties Went Silent**

> 
> No expulsion notices.
> No formal statements.
> No safeguarding reforms.
> From Tories to Labour, Lib Dem to UKIP—**zero accountability** once the resignation hits.
> 
> 
> 

---

**5. Return to Influence**

> 
> Some offenders later re-emerged as campaigners, columnists, or commentators.
> Because if you’re high enough up the ladder, **your fall is cushioned**.
> 
> 
> 

---

This wasn’t about hiding monsters in the basement.
This was **putting them on the council**, giving them seats at committees, and handing them influence.

> 
> The UK political establishment didn’t just ignore abuse.
> It systemised how to survive it.
> 
> 
> 

---

### **THIS ISN’T HISTORY. IT’S HABIT.**

From Parliament chambers to parish halls, they walked in as “public servants” and left as convicted predators.
And we, the people, were never told the full truth.

This isn’t about old names.
It’s about a **structure that still exists**, still shields, and still **selectively forgets**.

Because when you protect a predator once, you build a blueprint.
And **British politics perfected it.**

---

### **THE PROOF IS BELOW**

Every screenshot. Every record. Every name.

These are not allegations.
These are **archived convictions**, many of them public—yet buried in obscurity, shame, and silence.

An online source has published them all.
**Use them. Share them. Save them. Spread them.**
Because this data should’ve been front page **decades ago.**

### **WHY THIS MATTERS NOW**

Because some of these people **still hold influence**.
Because survivors were left **without justice**.
And because **if this many were caught—how many were missed?**

---

**This isn’t the end. It’s just the breach.**
The system wants you distracted.
We’re showing you the wiring.

And we won’t stop until every shadow is lit.
