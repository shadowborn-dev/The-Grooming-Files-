## ***The Porn Crisis***

### *“They made sex taboo — then sold it back as porn.”*

---

**It started with silence.**

We weren’t taught about sex.
We weren’t guided through desire.
We were shamed into ignorance and punished for curiosity.

Sex became something dirty. Dangerous. Hidden.

And then, when we were confused and disconnected,
**they sold it back to us.**

But not as love.
Not as connection.
**As porn.**

---

## What we weren’t allowed to explore — they packaged.

They filmed it. Filtered it.
Turned it into a product, an algorithm, an addiction.

Not education — exploitation.
Not intimacy — industry.

And we called it freedom.

---

**We were told porn was harmless.** Natural. Empowering.
But most people’s first experience of “sex” came not through trust, consent, or love, but through violent, degrading, commercialised content streamed in private silence.

> 
> A study by Brown & L’Engle (2009) found early exposure to sexualised media is linked to riskier beliefs and behaviours.
> Owens et al. (2012) found children exposed to porn were more likely to show lower empathy and more permissive sexual attitudes.

This isn’t sexual liberation.
It’s **psychological grooming** and it’s happening on a massive scale.

---

## Porn didn’t just change what we see.

It changed what we believe.

- That silence is consent

- That pain is pleasure

- That women are objects

- That dominance = desire

- That shame is sexy

And when that’s your first lesson in sex?
You don’t grow up connected.
You grow up confused.

Disconnected from your own body.
Desensitised to others’ boundaries.
Conditioned to expect performance, not presence.

---

## This is where it starts.

Not with a crime.
Not with an arrest.
Not in a dark alley or chatroom.

**It starts in plain sight.**
On a screen.
In silence.
At age 9. 10. 11.
Before a child even knows what real intimacy means.

And we don’t question it, because porn is normal now.
Expected. Personal. Unspoken.
**Until it isn’t.**

---

## In this series, I’ll show you:

- How porn grooms the brain before a predator ever does

- How fantasy becomes compulsion

- How escalation works

- How some sex offenders trace it all back to porn

- And how the system profits from the rot

This isn’t a call for censorship.
This is a call for **truth**.

Because what we’ve been sold isn’t harmless.
It’s hollowing us out and building something dangerous in its place.
