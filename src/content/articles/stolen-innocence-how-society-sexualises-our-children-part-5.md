**I’ve sat in conversations with predators. I’ve sat in conversations with survivors. I’ve written exposés where the system failed — not once, not twice, but daily, everywhere, beneath the surface.**
And I will tell you this: **the sexualisation of children is not a cultural debate. It is the modern frontline of child harm.**

The predators know it.
The survivors know it.
And every click, every algorithm, every corporate hand that feeds this pipeline knows it too.

## The Pattern Survivors Know Too Well

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file_00000000ac786243bc428c2bc7f0d14b5277899746881814494.png?w=1024)

From the voices I’ve published on *The Grooming Files* to the private messages that flood my inbox, the pattern is chillingly consistent:

Childhood sexualisation through media and online culture.
Early porn exposure shaping self-worth and consent.
Groomers stepping in with validation and “love.”
Abuse reframed as empowerment or choice.
A lifetime of shame and trauma — and an industry profiting at every step.

*"If we’d had today’s internet when I was being groomed, I’d never have survived it. Today the culture grooms you before a predator even speaks to you."*
— Survivor, UK, The Grooming Files message archive

## Voices We Cannot Ignore

*"He told me it was normal. That girls liked it rough. That’s what I’d seen in porn, so I thought I had to agree."*
— Survivor, interview, *Three Days With a Predator*

*"I was in a room full of grown men. I thought I’d done something wrong. But I’d been led there — because everything told me this was just what happened if you were wanted."*
— Survivor, UK — *The Generation the Internet Groomed — And the System Forgot*

*"I told my teachers. They told me maybe I misunderstood. That’s the culture now — if a girl dresses sexy or talks older, they think it’s her fault."*
— Survivor testimony, UK, 2024 inquiry submission

*"I watched a man on camera tell me he wanted to teach me things. I was 12. I thought I was special. No one told me what grooming looked like — porn had told me I should be flattered."*
— Survivor, global, *The Grooming Files* submission

## The Psychological Fallout

Survivors are paying in ways society refuses to face:

- **PTSD and flashbacks triggered by ordinary online content**

- **Hypersexualisation followed by deep shame and isolation**

- **Addictions rooted in trying to “reclaim” bodily control**

- **Relationships shaped by early porn scripts and abuse cycles**

- **Suicidal ideation and lifelong mistrust of adults**

*"I can't walk into a classroom to pick up my child without seeing the same body language, the same media that led me into abuse. We are setting these kids up and calling it freedom."*
— Survivor, UK, *The Grooming Files*

## What Professionals Are Now Seeing

**Safeguarding professionals, teachers, and therapists are seeing a tidal wave of harm:**

*"We’re seeing eight and nine-year-olds acting out porn they can’t possibly understand. We’re seeing boys who think consent is an optional part of sex. And girls who think their value lies in performing."*
— UK safeguarding lead, private interview

*"I deal with young men on probation for sexual harm who tell me they thought they were copying what everyone else did online. The culture is doing the grooming now."*
— Probation officer, England, 2024

*"Our children are in classrooms where they learn about kinks before they learn about self-respect. This is not education. This is laying a red carpet for predators."*
— Safeguarding teacher, UK, 2025

## The Survivors’ Warning

![](https://groomingfiles.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file-7fdnsuhg5gaaiishgej1xo281293704811798758053814.jpg?w=1024)

*"You will not undo this damage by being polite about it. We need people screaming from the rooftops. We need journalists who will say: this is not liberation. It is mass grooming, and it is funded and deliberate."*
— Survivor, global, *The Grooming Files*

*"We fight our way back from this. But the next generation? They are being thrown in younger and younger — and the adults are too scared to call it what it is."*
— Survivor, UK, *The Generation the Internet Groomed — And the System Forgot*

## **Every voice in this piece could be your child’s voice in 5 or 10 years — if we don’t fight now.**

They will tell us:
*"I thought it was normal."*
*"I thought it was love."*
*"I didn’t know I was being groomed."*

**How many more times will we hear it before we listen?**
**Because the ones profiting from this will not stop. The survivors are begging us to.**
