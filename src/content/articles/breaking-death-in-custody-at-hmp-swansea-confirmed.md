The death of a prisoner, Lee Draper at HMP Swansea has been officially confirmed by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO).

The incident occurred on **Wednesday 19 June 2025**. Until now, no public confirmation had been given, but today the PPO issued a formal statement:

> 
> *“The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is carrying out an independent investigation into the death of a prisoner at HMP Swansea on 19 June 2025. Our final investigation report will be made public after the inquest concludes.”*
> 
> 
> 

The identity of the deceased has not yet been released, and it is understood that next of kin notification delayed earlier public comment. No further details about the circumstances have been confirmed at this time.

HMP Swansea is a Category B men's prison in South Wales. This latest death adds to growing national concern over safety, healthcare, and accountability within the prison system.

This is a developing story. More updates to follow.

Edit: 23.06.2025 18.08pm

**A Prison Service spokesperson said:******

 “Lee Draper died in custody at HMP Swansea on 19 June, 2025.

“As with all deaths in custody, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will investigate.”
