We’ve been made aware of a disturbing incident that took place recently on **X2 wing** at HMP Parc.

A newly arrived prisoner, described by sources as vulnerable and unfamiliar with the wing. Was **sexually assaulted** shortly after arrival. The alleged perpetrator, an inmate with a known history of similar behaviour, was reportedly found **standing over the young person while masturbating**.

Despite the severity of the allegation, sources tell us that the response was shockingly casual. Staff on scene reportedly said:

> 
> “At it again, are you?”
> 
> 
> 

The result?
No arrest.
No safeguarding alert.
Just a **written warning**.

To be clear: a known offender, found in the act, was issued with a written warning and allowed to remain on the wing.

We’ve also been told this same individual recently **punched another young prisoner**, again without consequence. This raises a critical question: **how many more incidents have been minimised or ignored inside this wing?**

If true, this isn’t just a safeguarding failure, it’s a breach of basic human decency.

This young person was put in a system that promised safety, supervision, and a fresh start. Instead, they were met with predation. And silence.

We are urgently requesting further testimony, accountability, and a formal investigation into how this incident was handled and why nothing was done to protect the victim.

If you have any information or were present on X2 wing during this time, contact us in confidence.
