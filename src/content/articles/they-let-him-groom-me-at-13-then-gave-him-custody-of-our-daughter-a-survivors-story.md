#### She was 13...

#### He was 19!

He found her in a chat room.
Groomed her.
Abused her.
Raped her.
Controlled her.
For 17 years.

And when she finally escaped — the courts handed their daughter to him.

Let’s be clear:
**The system knew. And it handed him another child anyway.**

---

### **The Grooming Never Stopped. It Just Got Legitimised.**

This is the part no one talks about:

The criminal justice system didn’t protect her. It paid her.

**£22,000.** That’s what she got from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority — an official recognition that she was abused.

But recognition isn’t justice.
**Her abuser still walks free. Still has no conviction.**

Worse — the family court saw fit to grant him **residence of their 14-year-old daughter**. A girl he’s now grooming too.

How many red flags do they need?

---

### **How Many Times Must Survivors Be Failed?**

Let’s run this again:

- A teenage girl was groomed by a 19-year-old man.

- She endured 17 years of rape, control, and post-separation abuse.

- She raised his children.

- He never faced court.

- And now the court has delivered another child directly into his care.

You’d expect this in a dystopian novel. But this is happening *here*, *now*, *in Britain* — and no one is being held accountable.

---

### **These Aren’t Gaps in the System. They Are the System.**

People always ask: *“How could this happen?”*
As if it’s a mystery. As if it’s rare.

It’s not.

The system is built to protect men like him.
Men who are charming, manipulative, “respectable.”
Men who know how to play the role.
Men who know that **if they’re never convicted, they’re untouchable** — no matter how much damage they leave behind.

It protects fathers before it protects children.
It protects reputations before it protects lives.

---

### **Family Court Is One of the Most Dangerous Places for Survivors**

He didn’t just groom her.
He didn’t just rape her.
He didn’t just control her for years.

He **used the family court to keep control** — and the court let him.

Survivors are expected to co-parent with their rapists.
They’re told to “move on” while their abusers use child contact as a weapon.

This isn’t poor practice.
This is **state-sanctioned re-traumatisation**.

---

### **The Questions No One Wants to Ask:**

- Why does a compensation payout confirm abuse — but lead to no prosecution?

- Why does a family court ignore a man’s history of grooming and award him custody?

- Why are girls still expected to prove they were “abused enough” to be believed?

- Why are survivors discarded while predators are legally protected?

You know why.
Because challenging men like him would mean **challenging the institutions that shielded him.**

And they’d rather protect their image than admit complicity.

---

### **She’s Still Paying the Price. So Is Her Daughter.**

She said it best:

> 
> *“He stole my childhood… and now he’s doing it to our daughter.”*
> 
> 
> 

This isn’t history. It’s *still happening*.
He has legal access.
He has institutional protection.
And she lives with the daily grief of watching the cycle repeat itself — with no one stepping in.

Not the police.
Not the CPS.
Not the courts.

---

### **We Will Not Be Quiet About This**

This survivor didn’t want fame or pity. She just wanted the truth to be heard.

She spoke out through The Grooming Files because **she knew silence protects predators**.

And because she knows she’s not the only one.

We’ve received dozens of stories just like this.
Different names. Same pattern.
Same grooming.
Same disbelief.
Same system.
Same silence.

---

**To the survivors reading this:**
You’re not imagining it.
You’re not overreacting.
You were failed.
You’re still being failed.
And we see you.

**To the institutions protecting predators:**
We’re documenting.
We’re publishing.
We’re coming.

No more silence.
