# **How Big is the Problem?**

Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a **silent epidemic**—hidden, underreported, and devastating in its impact. Wales, like the rest of the UK, has **seen a rise in reported cases**, but does this mean CSA is increasing, or are more survivors simply coming forward?

This investigation **cuts through the noise**, looking at the **real numbers**, the **factors influencing reporting**, and the **failures and improvements in safeguarding children across Wales.**

---

## **The Hard Facts: What Do the Numbers Say?**

While **exact figures** on CSA remain difficult to determine due to **widespread underreporting**, what we do know is alarming:

- **7.5% of adults** in the UK report experiencing **childhood sexual abuse**—equivalent to **3.1 million people.**

- **Over 100,000** child sexual abuse offences are **recorded annually** by police in England & Wales.

- **One in three recorded sexual offences** involves **a child victim.**

### **Wales: A Regional Perspective**

- **Dyfed-Powys** reported **192 CSA image-related offences** in one year—**the lowest among Wales' four police forces.**

**CSA-related offences per 100,000 people:**

- **Gwent Police:** 84 (Highest in Wales)

- **North Wales Police:** 76

- **South Wales Police:** 74

- **Dyfed-Powys Police:** 37 (Lowest)

**Between 2018-2023**, Wales recorded:

- **13 under-18 offenders sentenced for CSA-related crimes.**

- **61 allegations of sexual assault against children under 10.**

- **20 child rapes in North Wales**—**more than triple** Dyfed-Powys' numbers.

## **Why CSA Appears Higher in Wales: The Bigger Picture**

Wales has seen **a significant rise in CSA cases being reported**—but this does **not necessarily** mean the crime itself has increased. **Several key factors** explain this surge:

### **More Victims Are Coming Forward**

- High-profile CSA cases have **encouraged survivors to speak out.**

- **Operation Soteria Bluestone** has increased police **focus on CSA detection and survivor support.**

### **Historical Abuse Cases Are Surfacing**

- Investigations into **long-standing institutional abuse**, such as the **Caldey Island scandal**, have **inflated CSA statistics.**

- Many cases **date back decades** but **only now** appear in official crime data.

### **Online Grooming & Digital Exploitation Are Surging**

- **More than half** of CSA cases now **involve online contact** between offenders and victims.

- In one year alone, **over 17,500 online grooming offences** were recorded in the UK—**a 40% increase in five years.**

### **Rural Policing Challenges**

- **Wales has large, rural areas**, making **detecting and preventing CSA harder** than in cities.

- Victims in **remote communities** often **struggle to access support services**—leading to **delayed reporting.**

---

## **Myth vs. Reality: Are Sex Offenders Being Moved to Wales?**

A common **public concern** is that convicted sex offenders are **relocated to Wales**—particularly **rural areas like Pembrokeshire**.

### **The Facts Say Otherwise:**

- **No evidence** exists to suggest that offenders are **deliberately moved to Wales.**

- **The number of registered sex offenders per 100,000 people in Dyfed-Powys is in line with national averages.**

- **MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) manages offenders nationally**—not regionally.

What is really happening? Increased **public awareness, exposure teams, and community-driven protests** have made CSA cases **more visible in Wales**—but this does **not mean the region is a dumping ground for sex offenders.**

## **High-Profile CSA Cases in Wales**

Public perception of CSA in Wales has been **heavily shaped** by major cases, including:

### **The Caldey Island Abuse Scandal**

- Over **30 years of child sexual abuse** was **covered up** in a **monastic community**.

- Victims came forward **decades later**, exposing **failures in church safeguarding.**

### **The Lewis Edwards Snapchat Grooming Case**

- A **Bridgend police officer** groomed **over 200 underage girls** online.

- He admitted to **160 CSA-related offences**, including **blackmailing victims into sending explicit images.**

### **Public Protests Against Offenders**

- **Milford Haven (2024):** **70 people protested** the release of a convicted sex offender.

- **Burton (2025):** **40 residents protested** the bail of a man accused of **abusing a baby.**

These **cases—and the media attention around them—fuel public fear**, but **the reality is more complex than headlines suggest.**

---

## **The Fight Against CSA in Wales: What’s Being Done?**

### **Law Enforcement Crackdowns**

- **Operation Soteria Bluestone**: A **police-led initiative** to **improve CSA investigations**.

- **Increased digital surveillance**: **Grooming gangs, online predators, and CSA material distributors are under more scrutiny than ever.**

### **Stricter Sentencing & Offender Monitoring**

- **MAPPA supervision of convicted sex offenders** has expanded.

- Wales has **one of the highest rates of refusal** for **offenders requesting removal from the sex offender registry.**

### **Public Awareness & Exposure Teams**

- Groups like **Dank Dragon**, **Predator Awareness **and **other predator-hunting teams** are **bringing more offenders to public attention.**

- More **victims are empowered to speak out** due to community-driven action.

---

## **What Needs to Change?**

Despite progress, **gaps remain** in tackling CSA in Wales. Key recommendations include:

- **More specialist CSA support services in rural areas.**

- **Greater police resources for online predator tracking.**

- **Better education for parents and children on online grooming.**

- **Harsher sentences for repeat CSA offenders.**

---

## **The Bottom Line: A Reality Check**

- **CSA in Wales is not higher than the rest of the UK—but it is more visible.**

- **Better reporting, hi8storic case reviews, and media attention make CSA seem more prevalent than statistics indicate**.

- **The biggest challenges remain online exploitation, rural policing difficulties, and access to survivor support.**
